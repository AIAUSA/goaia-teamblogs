This summer will be the 15th year AIA Wrestling has held a wrestling camp in Eastern Europe! We have been blessed to partner with Reality Sports, a ministry out of Seattle, to help form our team.

Our schedule is very busy with the first week wrestling practice, team Bible studies, visiting a cancer hospital for children, a Juvenal prison, church youth group, and a match hosted by a local church in Fastiv, Ukraine followed by a meet and great with the local youth group. The second week we have invited 120 wrestlers from 6 nations to come for a week to Kiev, Ukraine to grow in their sport and to hear the Gospel. Each day we will have two workouts and then a nightly program. At the conclusion of the camp we will have our "Friendship Duals", matches between the countries.
