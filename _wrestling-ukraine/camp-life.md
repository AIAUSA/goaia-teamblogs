We have had some great workouts at wrestling practice. Today the guys even got to have a former Russian national team member give only our boys a clinic for an hour!

We had our Bible Study material translated into Russian so we have been able to invite others to join us! The last few days we have had Ukraine, Moldova, and Latvia all in attendance. We had almost 30 people at the study today as we learned about the importance of Prayer and some new was to pray lead by coach Brian.
