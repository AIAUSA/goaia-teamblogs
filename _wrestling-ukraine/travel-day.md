The majority of our team started traveling early on Father's day from Seattle. We all met in Chicago and after a small delay with our plane to Germany we were on our way to Ukraine! It was fun to see the guys and start learning more about each others lives and prepare to share the next two weeks together.

As we landed in Ukraine we were met by our hosts the Korliuk family. Yuri has been a key volunteer for AIA Wrestling in Ukraine for many years. Yuri was on the Ukrainian national team for 14 years and is very respected by members of the wrestling community here. He has an engaging and lively personality. Our boys have quickly come to love hearing him say in his deep voice "American boys...lets go!"

Yuri's oldest daughter Nina has also been a key volunteer for us for many years even though she is only 20 years old. She is an amazing translator and organizer. We are very fortunate to have people like this leading our time while we are here.

We grabbed dinner and then jumped in the Dneiper river! We finally ended up at the sports camp we will be staying at late at night and headed to bed. We shave a full day ahead of us tomorrow.
