We woke up after a good night of sleep and had our first team Bible study. One of our goals of our teams is to equip athletes to become disciples who build build disciples. Our hope is that when guys return home they would be able start mentoring and leading others. Our study focused on how we play a part in God's story.

We than had a traditional Ukrainian breakfast of fried eggs, bread, oatmeal, and tea. The guys seemed to really enjoy it.

After breakfast we hoped on the bus and headed for our first practice with the Cadet national team. We started out practice by matching out guys up with their training partners. We then had a long warm-up, which was good for your guys to get the travel kinks out of their system, and some technique work. We finished off practice with some "live goes". Our boys did really well and seemed to hold their own.

Following practice we ate lunch and then headed to a children's hospital for cancer patience. All the kids were gathered and we did a display of wrestling, some magic tricks, back flips, and interviews with some of our boys. It was emotionally challenging to see the children and the affects cancer has had on them. But our boys brought many smiles to their faces.

We noticed one girl, about the boys age, who was waiting around after it was all over. We asked her if she wanted some pictures with the guys, and she quickly said yes! We found out she was having surgery tomorrow and asked her if we could pray for her. Brad lead our team in prayer, and did an awesome job! Our boys must have a "touch of allergies" because there was not a dry eye among our team or this young girl after we prayed and gave many hugs. It memory that she and our team will share for the rest of our lives and one of the greatest experiences I (Rob) have ever seen on our wrestling tours.

We finished off with dinner, some ice cream, and a ride on the ferris wheel in the town square. Tomorrow is another full day as we head to a Juvenile prison to play soccer and share.
