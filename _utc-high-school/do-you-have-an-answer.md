### **Meet the High School UTC Social Media Coordinator**

![](/uploads/2018/05/23/IMG_4123.JPG)

**Rick's Staff Role:**  Financial & Operational Analyst for AIA Sports TEAM

"My mission is to help our leadership and staff to be the best stewards possible of our ministry resources. I do this through developing systems and analytics to help our staff make better decisions as we share the gospel and help others to do the same. "

**My UTC Role:**  Social Media Coordinator and Blogger

I will be creating most of the content as our athletes experience this year's UTC. Please follow along so you can lift them up in prayer and share with others in your world how they may also become equipped to face life head on.

**Why am I excited about the HS UTC?:**  I did not know Christ growing up, and I had many questions that no one could really answer.  After meeting Christ, I found the answers I was seeking in my identity in Him.  Today, I use the skills God has given me to assist AIA in reaching more athletes for Christ. We strive to give them answers to their questions whether they are big (who am I?) or about everyday challenges.
