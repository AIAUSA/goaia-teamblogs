### Meet the X Project Intern Leaders:  Olivia

"My name is Olivia Llewelyn (pronounced Loo-el-in) and I'm going into my 5th year at Hillsdale College where I am a sports psychology major. I was a hurdler on the track field team at Hillsdale but am since retired. Being a part of the X Project internship is not my first go-around with Athletes in Action, as last year I was blessed to travel to the Canary Islands as part of an AIA track and field tour. It was on that trip where I fell in love with athlete ministry, missions and international travel. 

**Intern Role:**  "Because I knew I was going to take an extra year at Hillsdale, last summer I thought about applying for the 2018 X project internship, and I suppose that was God's plan for me this summer because here I am in Xenia! I'm excited to see how God will help me grow professionally, relationally, and most importantly, spiritually."
