As our high school UTC draws closer, you may be thinking about what it's going to be like?

Did you read the information letter we sent after registering?  If not, [here's a copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pc4aVXukarxDNTZP6ajN3lMl_LtnBQOiIY69eeitZ38/edit).

**Sunday** will start with registration at 1PM, followed by orientation at 3:30 PM.  Then we jump right into examining AIA Principle 1 after dinner and applying it in a volleyball lab.  Sunday evening will be capped off with a Game and Huddle time with Lights out at 11:00 PM.

#### **Monday - Wednesday will look something like this:**

\* Workshp

\* AIA Biblical Principle (classroom)

\* Principle Lab (practice time)

\* Field Time / Outreach / Challenge Cource

\* Evening Session

\* Fun / Small Group Activities

**Thursday** begins like the rest of the week and focuses on Principle 5.  Then our SPECIAL competition begins at 3 PM.  It will run through out the day Thursday and continue again on **Friday.**  There will be a dinner break Thursday evening and rest time before the Special continues early Friday morning. The UTC will finish up on Friday night with a special time of celebration, breakouts, sharing, and fun activities and a good night of sleep.

**Saturday** morning we have breakfast and you are on your way home by 9 AM!
