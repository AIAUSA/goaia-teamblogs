**Our Staff Role:**  Mike and Laurel have been on full-time staff with Cru for over 35 years, mostly with the High School ministry, and now with Athletes In Action. They have three married sons and another currently living at home and working nearby.

“Having worked with high school students for so long, we were very excited to be asked to work with AIA to serve on the 4th Ultimate Training Camp for high school students!

**Our HS UTC Roles:**  Assist in coordinating several camp events and leading athlete small groups.  We fill the gaps!

**Why we excited about the HS UTC?:**  "We are thrilled to be a part of it again this year, because we have seen first-hand how impactful it can be for these young athletes. Teaching [the 5 Principles](http://www.ultimatetrainingcamp.com/utc-principles) to teenagers has the potential to not only bring their involvement in sports to the next level in high school, but also to carry on through college and beyond, as these are actually life principles."
