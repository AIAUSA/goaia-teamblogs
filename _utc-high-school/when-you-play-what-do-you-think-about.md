### Principle 1:  Audience of One

When you compete, practice or just play sports casually, when goes through your mind?  Is your ability to play sport an idol in your life.  Maybe just winning.

Regardless, God wants us to reflect His excellent character through our effort, attitude, intensity and sportsmanship.

What does all that mean.  Join our athletes as Mark unpacked this principle with them during lab 1.
