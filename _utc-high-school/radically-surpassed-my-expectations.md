### Meet the X Project Intern Leaders:  Matt

![](/uploads/2018/06/19/Intern Matt UTC Bio.jpeg)

“My name is Matthew and I am a graduating Senior from North Carolina State University. I am studying Sport Management and currently pursuing an opportunity in the work place that combines two of the most important areas of my life: faith and sport. This summer I have the privilege of working with Athletes In Action and doing just that."

**Intern Role:**  "I will be operating in their Sports Complex and Retreat Center, assisting with the execution of a variety camps they hold, while also serving as a liaison for AIA to the sport teams that come on our complex. In the few short weeks I have been here thus far, the internship has radically surpassed the expectations that I set for it in the beginning. I am very excited to see what the rest of the summer holds and how I can grow with the Lord alongside Athletes In Action!”

**HS UTC Role:**  He will serve as a small group leader and in a variety of other roles during the camp.
