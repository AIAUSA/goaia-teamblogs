One of the big advantages to how the UTC's are set up centers on not only learning the 5 Principles, but stepping out right away to start applying them.

Everyone has developed their own way of responding to challenges in their sport and life.  It's a journey of faith to relearn how to compete and live freely in your new identity.

Listen to the Lab 2 and All Star match debriefings that took place earlier today.  The staff intentionally created a real life situation to allow our athletes to identify their spots of growth quickly.
