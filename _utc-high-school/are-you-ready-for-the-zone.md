### Meet the Challenge Course

Why is a Challenge Course a part of the High School UTC?

Whether you are talking about athletic competition or life, most of the limits we struggle with are related to our faith. Not just in what we can do, but more importantly what God can do in our lives.

The Challenge Course has two parts. The high and low ropes course are extremely helpful in building up all groups, especially UTC. The courses teach similar lessons, such as team building, communication, problem-solving, and trust.

If you are willing to step out of your comfort (self imposed limit) zone, you will build a strong foundation that will catapult you forward by building your faith in Him and what He can accomplish in you.

Not sure, listen to Brandon's invitation.  He's probably experienced some of the same limitations as you.
