### Meet the Challenge Course

**Why is a Challenge Course a part of the High School UTC?**

Whether you are talking about athletic competition or life, most of the barriers we struggle with are related to our faith. Not just in ourselves, but more importantly in what God can do in our lives.

The Challenge Course has a high and low ropes component. The are extremely helpful in teaching lessons, such as team building, communication, problem-solving, and trust.  All are critical for everyone on a successful team.

If you are willing to step out of your comfort zone and into the **_Challenge Zone_**, you will build a strong foundation that can catapult you forward by building your faith in Him and what God can accomplish in you.

Not sure, listen to Brandon's invitation.  He's probably experienced some of the same challenges.
