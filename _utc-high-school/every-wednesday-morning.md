### The Wednesday Morning Team

Every Wednesday morning since last July, members of the Athletes in Action High School Ultimate Training Camp have been praying for all the athletes attending our June 24th - 30th camp.

Over the last three months our team has been planning every aspect of the camp so each athlete will experience their ultimate training experience.  One that will help transform them not only into better athletes, but into the young man or women God desires them to be.

**Would you join the TEAM?**  The UTC staff are inviting you to lift up the HS UTC over the next week and to pray for the camp and those athletes attending each day from June 24th-June 30th.

**Will you accept the challenge?**  Please share this post with everyone you know who wants to make a difference in the lives of these young men and women.

**Rick for the Team**
