![](/uploads/2018/05/02/HS UTC 2018 Jeff E.jpg)

**Jeff's Staff Role:**  Local Team Lead for Dallas Metro. Hub Campus is SMU (Southern Methodist University)

"My role with AIA is building community with staff, coaches and players to lead their respective teams in "win, build, send" spiritual movements that Glorify the Lord."

**Jeff's UTC Role:**  Pre Camp Training and Principle Speaker

Jeff will be helping our staff cover the material to be shared with our HS UTC athletes during the camp.  He will also unpack some of the principles for the athletes as we introduce them each day.

**Why I am excited about the HS UTC?:**  "I Love summer camps and the role it plays in a students life. Praying God will reveal Himself to students through any of my interaction with students and staff."
