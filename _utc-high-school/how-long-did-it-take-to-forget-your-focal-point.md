Our first challenge to living out the Five Principles as we play our sport, let alone life is making the decision to buy in.  The second challenge is learning to change how you think about training, playing the game and how to react to life's experiences.

The purpose of Lab 3 is to help our athletes start this journey by helping then apply the principles practically in real life using a "Focal Point".

Take a look at one mid match coaching moment and the lab debrief:
