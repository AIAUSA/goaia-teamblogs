The past few days our AIA group has spent some time in the south of the Island in a city called El Medano, to spend some time focusing on God’s word and reflecting on our own personal relationships with Him. During the retreat we continued our discipleship time with the group and really just took in the beauty of where we were and all that God has done for us. Our first day we checked out the beach. It was beautiful! The sand was black, the water was blue, and the mountains in the background were breathtaking.

 I enjoyed my time on the beach by writing in my journal while catching a few sun rays. To me, it was the little things that caught my eye throughout our three days there. Things like walking along the beach with one of my best friends, and enjoying the scenic art work that God created by his own two hands. These really made me realize what an unbelievable God we worship. And then I realized just how easy it is to be ungrateful for what we have. I just thought it was crazy how the locals were so casual with their home and as I told them how beautiful it was, they replied with a shrug of the shoulders and “ehh.” I live in a small town in Texas and there are no mountains or oceans in my backyard.  I couldn’t imagine living here everyday and just taking this beautiful island for granted. 

And then I thought of all the beautiful places I could see in my small town. Like watching the sunrise on Lake Fork, and riding horses through the pasture with my family while checking the cows, and east Texas sunsets...those are amazing. 

  
I have learned many, many lessons while on this trip, but one of the biggest ones God has revealed to me is how blessed we really are. While the Canary Islands are BEAUTIFUL and definitely all it’s cracked up to be, it’s not home. It’s not surrounded by my family and by my childhood memories or friends that love me. In our Christian walk we can experience these same things. We believe that worldly things can bring us happiness and our own selfish desires can fulfill us. However, temporary things give temporary fulfillment and only God can truly make us whole. 

  
As I was walking on the beach, Sam said “I feel like I’m in a movie.” This made me feel, as cheesy as this sounds, so alive and present for the first time in the trip. At the beginning of the trip I was so homesick that all I could think about was going home on June 20th. And slowly, thoughts of home started to slip away and I really began enjoying my time with our group and I felt God really was working in my life. It’s so easy to want to look at other people doing “great” things in their lives and just be so ungrateful for my present situation. 

As a student athlete there’s no time for vacations. You go to school, you go to practice, you go home, you do homework, and then you wake up and repeat. When I see other students (that don’t work full time) enjoying their college experience, it’s so easy to want that free time and flexibility. They go to the beach on spring break while we drive five hours to a track meet. 

However, through athletics I have been blessed to have this opportunity to be on this trip with AIA doing work for the Lord while growing with teammates who are sisters and brothers in Christ. It made me realize that at times life may be so busy yet so slow that we can take for granted all that we have during that moment. We are just too impatient to notice that in the stillness of life, God is working on something even greater for us. 

So be present!! Be thankful!! Because God is doing his work in the meantime.
