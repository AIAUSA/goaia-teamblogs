Meet Sammi Jo! This East Texan is a multi who competes for Stephen F. Austin. She is excited to get out of her comfort zone to see how the Lord will use her there and learning how to integrate her faith with track.

"I am praying that Christ will open my heart to everything He has for me throughout this entire process, to teach me just who He is in my life and through track; along with teaching me to be bold while sharing His love to others."

She would love your prayers for complete financial trust and that the Lord begins to prepare her heart for everything that will happen on this trip.[#aiatrack](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/aiatrack?source=feed_text) [#track](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/track?source=feed_text) [#merryincanary](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/merryincanary?source=feed_text)

Caitlin, another multi from SFA, is from Alba, Texas. She is looking forward to joining her two teammates and to grow in their faith together.

"I pray that God works through me in a way that will bring someone to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and that He will open my eyes to all the things He knows I need to see."

As she prepares for the trip, please be praying for safe travels and for confidence that the Lord will use her as she is to influence those who need Him. [#aiatrack](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/aiatrack?source=feed_text) [#track](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/track?source=feed_text) [#MerryinCanary](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/merryincanary?source=feed_text)
