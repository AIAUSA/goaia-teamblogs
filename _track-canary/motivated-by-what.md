This morning, Sunday, we visited a local church. Two team members shared their testimonies, while I (Joel) preached the sermon. This is only the third time I've preached- the two previous times occurring on this trip in 2016 and '17.

As I was prepping my sermon a couple of weeks ago, the only thing I felt led to preach on was the parable of the Prodigal Son, found in Luke 15. For some reason, this parable had been on my mind a lot this past month. The parable is also taught in Athletes in Action's Principle 2, which is titled "Inside Game." This Principle teaches how we as Christ followers can be motivated by God's love for us, instead of worldly pleasures or self-righteousness.

Basing my sermon off of this parable and Principle 2, I shared that in my life I often identify as the older son, who thought that he could earn his father's love because of his obedience. I actually did believe that as an athlete, I would perform better in my sport if I was more obedient to God, and that my performance could suffer if I was acting in disobedience.

I shared with the congregation that the older son is motivated by self-righteousness, and the younger son is motivated by worldly pleasures. However, the Father is motivated by his relationship with His sons. He treats both sons equally, even though they view their relationship with their Father very differently.

I told the congregation that whether they doubt that God would forgive them, or whether they feel they've earned God's favor, what God desires most is their love- and our motivation in life should come from God's love for us.

After the service, a British couple approached me and told me that at their home church, their pastor had just finished a six week series on the Prodigal Son, and they were delighted to hear a message on the same subject but from a different perspective.

Also, I learned that a Spanish lady had just been at a ladies' retreat in which the teaching centered around the Prodigal Son. She too expressed that God had spoken to her through my sermon. Apparently, she left the retreat unsure how to identify with either son, but understanding the Father's love in the story helped her understand how God loves her.

I prayed last month that the Holy Spirit would guide me on what to preach, and all that came to mind was the Prodigal Son. Before church, I prayed that God would use my sermon to minister to the congregation, and He answered that prayer as well!

Next Sunday we will visit a different church, so pray for God to use the team and I to encourage the believers there as well!

Joel, for the team.
