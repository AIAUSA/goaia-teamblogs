Have you ever experienced one of those cool "God moments?" 

This morning, Sunday, our team visited a local church. Two of our members shared their testimonies, while I (Joel) preached the sermon (my third time the past three years). 

As I began to write my sermon a couple of weeks ago, the only thing I felt led to preach on was the parable of the Prodigal Son, found in Luke 15. For some reason, this parable had been on my mind a lot in the past month.  Athletes in Action teaches a principle titled "Inside Game," which is based on the parable of the Prodigal Son. This Principle teaches how we as Christ followers can live life being motivated by God's love for us, instead of by worldly pleasures or self-righteousness.

I shared in my sermon that in my life I often identify as the older son, who thought that he could earn his father's love because of his obedience. As an athlete, I actually did believe that the better I behaved toward God, the better I would perform in my sport. I also believed that my performance could suffer if I was acting in disobedience.

I shared with the congregation that while the older son is motivated by self-righteousness, and the younger son motivated by worldly pleasures, the Father is motivated by his relationship with His sons. He treats both sons equally, even though they view their relationship with their Father very different.

I told the congregation that whether we doubt God's forgiveness, or if we feel we've earned God's favor, what God desires most is for us to love Him wholeheartedly. The relationship we have with Him should influence how we live our lives.

After the service, a British couple approached me and told me that at their home church, their pastor had just finished a six week series on the Prodigal Son. The couple was delighted to hear a message on the same subject, yet from a different angle.

Also, I learned that a Spanish lady had just been at a ladies' retreat in which the teaching centered around the Prodigal Son. She too expressed that God had spoken to her through my sermon. Apparently, she left the retreat unsure how the parable directly applied to her life. But she left church on Sunday morning understanding that the way the father loved his sons in the parable is the same way He loves her. 

I prayed last month that the Holy Spirit would guide me on what to preach, and all that came to mind was the Prodigal Son. So I decided to run with that idea and trust that God would use it. Before church, I prayed that God would use my sermon to minister to the congregation, and He answered that prayer!

Next Sunday we will visit a different church, so pray for God to use the team and I to encourage the believers there as we did at this church!

Joel, for the team.
