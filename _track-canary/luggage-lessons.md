Jillian, Caitlin and I started our trek to Ohio early Saturday morning. I have only flown once before so with three connecting flights starting in Houston, the nerves were most definitely present. Even though the flight was under an hour to San Antonio, I think it might have been the worst. Then after that, we were smooth sailing. Until we arrived at baggage claim in Cincinnati..

Caitlin found her bag almost immediately and Jill’s wasn’t far after. Then after the same few, uncollected bags circled around for quite some time I started to wonder if mine was going to shoot out or if someone had mistaken mine for theirs. I tried not to freak out and act like I was bothered, but two weeks in a foreign country with only one change of clothes didn’t seem too exciting! Luckily, the man at the baggage claim issues desk was as kind as could be. He entered a claim with all my information, apologized a million times, and promised that they would find a solution. I went throughout my day praying that my luggage would show up soon, but there was a constant image in my head that it wouldn’t happen. We kept talking about the possibility of our bags getting lost, and mine actually did!

Late that night, the same sweet man at the desk who helped me, left a voicemail saying they found my bag and were ready to deliver! Mr. Ellis’ home just so happened to be within the radius for delivery so before I knew it my suitcase was on the AIA campus with me!

Even though I was so excited to see what God had in store for this summer, I’ve been nervous about traveling so far away for a few months. Then at the beginning of the trip, something goes wrong. I worried if I would have enough clothes to last through the trip. I worried about losing all the things in my bag. I was still worried about the trip and traveling, in general. I was beginning to let my heart and mind be consumed by everything but what Christ had/wanted for me. The worry and doubt over the blessing and opportunity. The potential material loss over the spiritual fill-up we were about to receive.

Through this silly ‘misplaced’ baggage, I could feel God telling me to put my worries aside and keep my eyes set on Him. He’s already there, and has everything taken care of. We have trusted Him through this whole process and so why should I lose faith now? I am so thankful for His lessons, blessings, and taking care of every detail.

PS, always pack a carry on!

“Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?”
