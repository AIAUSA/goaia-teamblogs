We got up at 4:30am on Saturday (the 9th). The morning was shrouded in darkness and anticipation. The Tenerife Bluetrail half marathon was upon us! Every race day feels special, but I knew that this one was going to be extraordinary before my feet hit the floor. 

This was not your every day kind of race (unless you climb mountains in the pouring rain every day). The seemingly endless incline and tractionless mud were enough to push many athletes to their limits. It’s a good thing that our God has no limits! 

I felt God’s presence with me from the start to the finish of the race. In case you are wondering, He makes the best running partner! He gave me the strength and endurance to run this race with confidence. This was a really cool gift. But He didn’t give it to me so I could tell people that I had a great race and felt fantastic. I think He gave it to me because He wanted to have a conversation and didn’t want me to be distracted by stress and exhaustion.

We had conversations about gratitude, perseverance, strength, weakness, joy, pain, circumstances, and so much more. But the conversation that we had about community is the one I want to share with you now. 

There was a three mile stretch in the middle of the race where I was running solo. None of my teammates were around. At one point I was going down a very steep and muddy hill. Slipping and sliding, I felt a bit helpless without a teammate to support me. In an effort to save my balance I grabbed a low hanging branch. Immediately, it became apparent that this branch was covered in thorns! As I wiped the blood and mud from my hands, I realized that some of the things we reach out to in our distress are not good for us. 

Right now, I am in a season of life that is filled with many moments of solitude. It’s easy for me to feel helpless, but I need to rely on God to be my strength. Even when I feel alone, He is always with me. And when I do reach out for help, I need to make sure that the people and things I am grabbing onto will serve to help me and not to hurt me. It’s always good to make sure that your community isn’t a thorn bush.

Shortly after this, I caught up to three of my teammates. Just as God does not intend for us to live our lives in solitude, He did not intend for me to run this race alone. We encouraged and pushed each other along the way. Good community can be so refreshing!

With about four miles to go, the path began to level out. I was tempted to take off, forget the team, and see how fast I could finish as an individual. But God had a better idea. 

One of my teammates, Micah (a.k.a. Santiago), got muscle camps in his legs and started to drop off of the pack. The other two were feeling good, so they were speeding up. In that moment, I felt God call on me to give up the last bit of selfish ambition that I was clinging to and finish the race with Micah. 

Nobody on our team finished alone. We all walked away with some great stories of how we were able to encourage and be encouraged by our teammates. Each person showed by their actions that they cared more for their teammates than they did for themselves. This painted a beautiful picture of the body of Christ and the community that it forms. 

Now, a few days later, the cuts and bruises are healing. The aching muscles are slowly releasing their painful grip. As the physical marks of this race fade into our past, I pray that the spiritual marks will be engraved on our hearts forever. I know that I will never forget the Tenerife Bluetrail and all that God taught me there.

Hannah, for the team

“Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.” 

Philippians 2:3-4
