We left our Hostel in Barcelona this morning at 5am to catch our flight to Lisbon. Fortunately, we made it to the airport very quickly without any issues. Everyone slept on the plane, and when we got off the plane, everyone got some Starbucks. I had a delicious Frozen Carmelo Frappuccino, but also went off to get myself a raspberry tart. The tart was pretty divine if you were wondering. 

After meeting up with our Portuguese liaisons, we hopped on the Benfica team bus, a double decker bus with the softest seats that is bound to put you to sleep. It took us to the team hotel (I mean resort) where we will be staying for the next 11 days. We had to wait for an hour or so before we could check into our rooms so we explored the place, and spent time pool-side, getting tan. We had our first meal here, and had some of the finest Portuguese cuisine. They laid out a buffet of different cuts of sliced meats, baked breads, fresh fruit, mixed rice and stewed fish. My favorite was the rice pudding for dessert.  After chilling out, we went to the training grounds to get some work in. We trained on a turf field over looking the bay/ocean. We then finished with a nice dinner at their cantina. We came back to the hotel and had the night off, but did a small devotional led by one of our captains. 

Overall a busy but great day!
