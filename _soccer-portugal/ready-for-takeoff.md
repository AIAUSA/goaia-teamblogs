Greetings!

The 2018 Athletes in Action Soccer Tour is here and we couldn't be more excited. We've reached the beginning of an opportunity and an experience that has been 8 months in the making and as over 30 of us journey to New York City from all over the country today, we have expectant hearts for the awesome-ness that God is about to facilitate. 

A basic schedule: Today, over the course of the afternoon, we will meet in NYC. Tomorrow evening, our flights depart for Barcelona, Spain, where the boys will be put through an intense 4-5 days of "pre-season" training, getting acclimated to our system of play and each other. From there, we will travel to Lisbon, Portugal, where we will spend the rest of our trip. 

This trip is an opportunity to play great soccer, learn how our sport and our faith intersect in very practical ways and an opportunity to let God use each individual, through soccer, to advance His kingdom. 

We want you to be a part of this experience. Please check back here as we will be updating this blog daily. Thank you for your generous support thus far of our players and staff, both financially and through prayer. 

**But keep praying!**

We want our efforts and the effects of God's hand on this trip to be maximized. Continue to pray for safe travels, a seamless itinerary and that the bonds that we already have through Christ will begin sowing deeply the second we all meet today in NYC. 

Grace and Peace,
