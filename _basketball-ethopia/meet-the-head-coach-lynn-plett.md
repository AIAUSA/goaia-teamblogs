We are honored to have Coach Lynn Plett joining us on our women's basketball tour to Ethiopia this summer! He is also the most recent winner of the FCA Kay Yow "Heart of a Coach" award. More information below...

Lynn Plett came to the University of Colorado @ Colorado Springs two years ago and led the Mountain lions to their first RMAC championship and to the semifinals of the NCAA Div.II Regional Championship.  He has been coaching at the collegiate level for nearly forty years.  His first head coaching position was as Head Men’s Basketball Coach at Marymount College in Salina, Kansas.  From there he moved to Huntington University in Indiana as the Head Men’s Coach.  Five years later he accepted the Athletic Director/Head Women’s Basketball Coach position at St. Joseph’s College in Indiana.  After eight years at St. Joseph’s he moved to Lewis University in Illinois as the Head Women’s Basketball Coach and then to Missouri Western State University five years later.  Prior to coming to the University of Colorado @ Colorado Springs he was the Assistant Coach at Northern Kentucky University.

> It is an honor to be asked by AIA to coach this basketball team as we travel to Ethiopia.  This will be my fourth trip overseas with a basketball team, the first being as a collegiate player when our team traveled to South Africa.  On each of these trips God has not only blessed our outreach efforts of sharing the “Good News” with the people of the country we visited, but He also brought about significant spiritual growth in the lives of each team member.  To once again be a part of such an experience and return again to Africa is something I look forward to with great expectations of seeing God’s hand work through His Spirit in the lives of the people we meet as well as within my own life.
