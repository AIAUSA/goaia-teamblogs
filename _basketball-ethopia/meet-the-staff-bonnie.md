Bonnie Durrett is on the AIA Women's Basketball staff in Xenia, OH. She will be assisting in discipleship while on our Ethiopia tour and playing as well. 

> I am so looking forward to our time in Ethiopia together, as I believe that God will do great things in us and through us! I look forward to pouring into the women on our team and the people we interact with, and I'm so excited to grow closer together, closer to the Lord, and to share with others about Him through such a fun and influential platform.Â
