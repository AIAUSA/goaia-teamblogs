Yesterday, June 7, we were able to go to Yehiwet Birhan School in Addis. Here we were able to put on a basketball clinic for the basketball team and some other kids around the area. So far, this has been the most exciting but tiring day for most of our team. 

It took us around an hour on the bus to get to the school, and these long bus rides have become some of my favorite memories. Being Americans, people on the street stare at us as we drive by. I love to make eye-contact with the people and give them a big smile and wave. Most of the time they smile really big back or give a quick eyebrow raise. We may not speak the same language, but we can communicate with a smile. 

When we first got to the school, there was just an abundance of children. My heart instantly became filled with joy, I love kids!! At first, the kids were very scared to talk to us, but they were definitely curious about who we were. One by one, we were able to break down the barriers by asking their names and how old they were. You could see their faces start to light up, and the joy began bursting out of them. It was amazing to see how entertained the kids were by just making a pass and then going to the end of the line. While some of the older kids were passing, there wasn’t enough basketballs for all of the kids, so I took a group of little kids over and just began to run in a circle with them. The happiness that came onto their faces was something that I will never forget. It was in those moments that I experienced the pure joy that Jesus Christ brings. 

Matthew 25:40, “And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.”
