5/31 was the last day in Xenia, Ohio before the team had taken off and headed for Ethiopia.

We had a practice that morning around 10am and we had been preparing for our Prison Game that night. The prison game would be the first game we would play a game together as a group. For being in an unfamiliar environment and practicing a total of 4 times, we did alright! The prisoners played really well! They made us pay with lay ups, played tough defense, and hit many 3 pt. shots. Some of us were challenged with our own sociological perspectives of the women from the facility because of the stigma that the world places on convicts. It was amazing to watch the sport of basketball break down barriers and allow us to share the gospel with a group of women that are often shamed and/or feared by society. 

To close out the first half the opposing team scored and were up by 2. The crowd was going wild. The second  time  that the crowd went wild was when AIA athlete Imani shared her testimony of viewing the Lord through a lens of faith and love rather than viewing God as an authoritarian that keeps tabs on your every action. You could see the Holy Spirit working in that moment to tug on the hearts of the members of the audience. We continued to play a very competitive second half. The score wavered back and forth by 2’s up until the last 3 minutes of the game. Following the game we broke off into 2 small groups and the women shared their thoughts with us with a game called solarium. We got to hear about their lives now and their hopes for the future. A couple of them had felt comfortable enough to share their testimonies with us and challenged us to think in such a way where our humanity was the great equalizer. We found a commonality in our brokenness  We had given each other hugs and some had even stick around to really words of encouragement to others. 

They had challenged us to play better basketball and to dream big dreams. 

We then attempted to get back to the AIA campus so that we would be packed and ready to head to the airport at 2am the following morning. We’re grateful for the work that the Lord has done with this group on U.S. soil, but we are well prepared and excited to see how the Lord has been working in Ethiopia and what He is going to do with our time there. 

As we travel, it would be greatly appreciated if you kept this group in your thoughts and prayers!
