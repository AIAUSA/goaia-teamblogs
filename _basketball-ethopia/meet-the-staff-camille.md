Hey y’all, I’m Camille! Last month I graduated from grad school at Georgia State and last year I married my best friend, Brandon. I played college soccer and studied athletic training at Appalachian State. Thanks to AIA I learned how to use my platform as an athlete and now as an athletic trainer to help spread the love of Christ through sports. I am so pumped to be the athletic trainer for this tour! This will be my fourth AIA trip, but my first to Ethiopia.
