The last several days in Addis, we have played two games and run several clinics around the city. We've loved every minute of getting to sit down with teams and hear about their lives and share our faith with them. Everyone has been beyond welcoming, and we are so grateful we've had the opportunity to serve and share our love for Christ and knowledge of basketball, while learning so much from them at the same time.

Pictured above are some of the girls before our clinic at Bingham Academy, a local Christian school here in Addis where missionaries from all over the world who serve in the area send their children. We were amazed at the amount of cultures and backgrounds represented in their school!

Half of our group ran camps all day in the gymnasium, while the other half went from classroom to classroom sharing testimonies and answering questions that the kids had. Some were silly and fun, like, "If you had a superpower, what would it be?" while others from older students went a bit deeper... If we go to a Christian college in America, does that mean all the students are Christians? How do maintain our faith when we move away and go to school?

We couldn't have asked for a better experience there, and we are looking forward to what the rest of the trip has in store! Thanks so much for your prayers!
