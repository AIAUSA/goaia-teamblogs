With just under two weeks before our team arrives in Xenia, we're busy wrapping up the final preparations here at our World Headquarters. In the meantime, we'd like to introduce our staff team that will be leading the Ethiopia tour! Get to know Holly, our Tour Discipler, a bit more below... 

> Holly has been on staff with Athletes in Action for four years. She is a local team leader for the campus ministry in Wisconsin, spending most of her time working with student athletes on the University of Wisconsin campus. Although she was never a basketball player, Holly is excited to go on this tour to Ethiopia to invest deeply in the players and coaches while on this trip.
