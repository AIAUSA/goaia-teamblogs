> I'm super excited about this trip because I get to combine my love for Jesus, for basketball, and for youth all at once in an amazing opportunity that takes place in Ethiopia, a country I've never been to, let alone I have never stepped foot on the continent of Africa and yet I feel so connected. I'm excited to share my testimony and the Gospel. I'm excited to play the game I love and teach it too! This is just such a golden moment to embrace and give all its glory to God who created it!
