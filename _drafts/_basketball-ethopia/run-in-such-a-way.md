On Monday, May 28th, we arrived on campus for training camp in preparation for our tour to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia!

We kicked off the day with some fellowship at Denise’s house over a home-cooked meal and a few fun volleyball matches.

The next morning we dove right into team time led by Holly. We learned about the importance of sharing our testimonies and how it is Gods story that He wrote for us and it is worthy to share!

Our first team practices have been going really well! Coach Plett spoke on our mission statement as a team for this tour - to “Run in Such a Way” - referring to 1 Corinthians 9:24. As a team, we are to run in such a way that is glorifying to God, despite the outcome on the scoreboard.
