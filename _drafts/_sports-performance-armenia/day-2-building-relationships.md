We started our second day in Armenia with a team Bible Study on the Holy Spirit, sharing  and learning from God’s Word about how to be directed and empowered by the Holy Spirit. Our plan is to gather each morning for study of God’s Word. This is an essential part of our day as we seek to stay in step with God’s will for our time here.

Our first teaching session today was at the National Kinesiology University. Our 2 1/2 hours with the students there focused on a discussion on nutrition for sort and how to recognize and know when to refer a head injury. We split up for our afternoon session with John and Noah going with Tigran to a wrestling club to do a clinic. John is received very well by Armenians, who love the sport of wrestling. Paul and Doug stayed at the New Life Armenia ministry headquarters to teach on concussion and sudden death in sports. The sports doctors who are coming to these meetings are from the top levels of sport in Armenia. They have recently formed an Armenian Sports Medicine Federation and hope to be a positive influence on their nation. Our prayer is to be used by God to be a odor I’ve influence on both the wrestlers and the sport doctors so they can impact their country, and also those countries around them.
