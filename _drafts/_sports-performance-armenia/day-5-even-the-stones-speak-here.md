It's Monday after Easter and we have had another full day here in Armenia. Our day started with a Bible Study on Holy Sweat/Wholly Surrender. This title comes from the AIA Principles...Bible Studies that express the Gospel applied to sport, experienced through sport, in the language of sport. This Priciple asks the question, “How will I grow?” 

As John leads us in this look at God's Word I was reminded of Jesus' sweat. He was under such pressure that he sweat blood. Nothing I face on this trip or in my life will bring that kind of pressure. Yet, the challenges I face will help me grow as I surrender to His power and plan for my life.

We left soon after our breakfast Bible study for a tour of the Armenian Olympic Training Center. John was able to make some good connections for Tigran with the wrestling coaches. One wrestler remembered John from our AIA team last year that trained here with them for a week. Our prayer is that that trip and this one will open doors for Tigran to minister to the athletes training at this complex!

We spent our afternoon touring the oldest cathedral in the world... Etchmiadzin! Built in the fourth century, it has survived wars and earthquakes and more. Our guide, Vardan who is the President of New Life Armenia (Campus Crusade for Christ) explained how the Gospel can be told through the carvings on the ancient cross stones that can be found all over this country.

Our day was finished with a celebration of Easter with the New Life Armenia staff. There was more traditional Armenian Easter food, music and comedy. Our hosts were very gracious
