It's Monday after Easter and we have had another full day here in Armenia. Our day started with a Bible Study on Holy Sweat and Wholly Surrendered. This is the title of AIA's Principle 3, which is an appropriate title for the day after we celebrate our Lord's resurrection! Will we surrender fully to the Holy Spirit's work in our lives? This study asks, "How do I grow?" It's focused on 1st Timothy 4:8 and 2nd Timothy 3:16-17. As John Peterson leads us in this look at God's Word I was reminded of Jesus' sweat. He was under such pressure that he sweat blood. Nothing I face on this trip or in my life will bring that kind of pressure. 

We left soon after our breakfast Bible study for a tour of the Armenian Olympic Training Center. John was able to make some good connections for Tigran with the wrestling coaches. One wrestler remembered John from our AIA team last year that trained here with them for a week. Our prayer is that that trip and this one will open doors for Tigran to minister to the athletes training at this complex! 

We spent our afternoon touring the oldest continuous standing cathedral in the world... Etchmiadzin! Built in 306 AD, it was a great tour and our guide, Vardan who is the President of New Life Armenia (Campus Crusade for Christ) explained how the Gospel can be told through the ancient cross stones that can be found all over this country. 

Our day was finished with a celebration of Easter with the New Life Armenia staff.
