Welcome to the student blog for the Urban Project – Los Angeles (UP-LA). We invite you to visit this page daily to follow the events and course of the Urban Project.

         Beginning June 4th, students and staff will use the pages of this blog to share stories, updates, and write about the events of the Urban Project from their various perspectives. We think you’ll enjoy reading about the UP-LA from these differing viewpoints. We also believe you’ll see the brilliance and leadership of this generation of student-athletes as they serve and experience and engage communities of need in South Los Angeles.

         In addition to teaching these phenomenal students how to honor and uphold the testimony of Jesus Christ in their athletic and personal lives, together Project participants will tackle the concepts of culture, race, class, power, poverty, privilege, responsibility and justice, as well as what the Gospel of Christ has to say about these ever-relevant and important issues.

Again, bookmark this page and visit every day to keep up with what’s going on at Athletes in Action’s 2018 Urban Project – Los Angeles!
