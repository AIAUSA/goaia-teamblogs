Today was an incredible first start to our tour in Barcelona. We took off from JFK and landed in Barcelona around 730 AM. We immediately hopped on a bus and drove to our training facility where we had our first session of the tour. During the session the guys were able to get a good start by getting some quality touches and possession going to loosen up our legs. We bussed backed to our hostel where we checked in our luggage to our rooms and had a makeshift lunch of break, ham and cheese sandwiches. So far on this trip everybody has done a great job of being adaptable.

After about an hour we had to walk and take the metro back to our training facility for the second session. It took about 45 minutes to get there which was definitely a challenge considering the size of our group. Nonetheless, both teams showed a great effort and intensity at training which highlights the character of the players and staff that are on tour. Afterwards we took the metro back to the hotel and showered before grabbing dinner.

Praise God for travel mercies for both sets of flights that arrived safely in Barcelona from JFK. God was so good to provide our team with great hosts who were able to facilitate our travel to and from our training facility. Navigating our entire team through the metro was not an easy task but all our team members and equipment made it safely there and back.

Prayer requests for the remainder of the trip include our travel to and from training tomorrow as we have to travel via metro for both sessions. More importantly, we would like to pray for the remainder of our staff who is flying out to meet us later in the trip and that God would have his hand on their travels.
