Joel is heading back to the Canary Islands for the third time. He keeps returning because it's the best opportunity God uses him to minister in his sport (race walking). He is able to connect with fellow athletes who may not know Christ and help younger athletes develop spiritually. As the team's director, he sees God use this trip to work in the lives of people, including himself. He's looking forward to how the Lord will work once again this summer.

Here are specific ways you can be praying for him as he prepares: "This year, I am not as physically fit as I was the previous two years. Pray that God will take my fitness level as it is and maximize it for his purposes. Pray that as I lead the team, I will 'get out of the way' so God will work in me as he chooses. Finally please pray for one or two more guys to join the team!" [#aiatrack](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/aiatrack?source=feed_text) [#track](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/track?source=feed_text) [#MerryinCanary](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/merryincanary?source=feed_text)

Paul will be taking his fifth trip to the islands! He keeps going back for a very simple reason:

"I believe that this is a unique calling from God. Seems cliche and possibly corny, but why do anything if it's not His desire? Being faithful, obedient, and willingly available is what matters."

Being a believer, Christ follower, and long time AIA member, he views it an honor and privilege to serve the team, and prayerfully, he will be able to mentor, support, and encourage each team member.
