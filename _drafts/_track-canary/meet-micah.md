Please help us welcome Micah to the team! He is originally from Yakima, Washington and is attending Northwest Nazarene. He's looking forward to sharing his faith and love of Christ through his sport, as well as experiencing a new culture and spending time with the community there.  

"I pray that I will be able to exemplify the Lord through my actions and be able to witness to people through how I interact."   As he prepares for the trip, please pray he views this as not a vacation, but that he stays focused on the people and the mission the Lord has for them. #aiatrack #track #MerryinCanary
