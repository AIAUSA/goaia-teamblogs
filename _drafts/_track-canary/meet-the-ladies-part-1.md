Rachel, a sophomore at Cornerstone University, is a commercial music major and runs the long stuff in track! "I am looking forward to using my gifts to share in community with people from another country, and learning to worship God with what I have. I am praying that through this trip I can make new and lasting relationships with people on the team and on the Canary Islands. I am also praying that I can trust God with my life and know that he has a plan for my life, even if it may not be the route I would have chosen." Please pray the Lord prepares her heart to go out of her comfort zone and that she knows she is not alone in this. [#aiatrack](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/aiatrack?source=feed_text)[#track](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/track?source=feed_text) [#MerryinCanary](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/merryincanary?source=feed_text)

Jillian, a Houston native, is one of three Stephen F. Austin multi athletes on this team!

"I’m so excited to be growing in my faith with God. I have really jumped out of my comfort zone and I hope to keep learning how God can use me to teach others of his powerful word. I thank him so much for this opportunity to use what I have so much passion for (track) to show and explain Gods love to the people in Canary!

Please pray that I keep my heart open and I strengthen my relationship with him and my teammates! Also- that I can use everything I learn through this experience in the future and continue to grow by doing so!" [#aiatrack](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/aiatrack?source=feed_text) [#track](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/track?source=feed_text)[#MerryinCanary](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/merryincanary?source=feed_text)
