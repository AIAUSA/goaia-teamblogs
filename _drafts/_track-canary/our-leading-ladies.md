Lauren will serve the Canary Island's team as the team discipler. She graduated from Sacramento State University in 2017 and has been interning with AIA at Sac State. She was a thrower and has an extreme sugar addiction and loves lifting weights!

She is looking forward to bringing one of her disciples with her on the trip and living out the Great Commission together (Matthew 28:18-20). She is also excited to experience a new culture and learning more about God's character and who He is through His people.

"I am boldly praying for the Lord to allow me to have a conversation that leads to a decision for Christ. I am also praying he uses us to open doors and hearts in the Canary Islands for God's other laborers to harvest."

As she prepares for the trip, please be praying she makes this trip a priority as the end of the semester ministry can be quite busy and time consuming. Also pray for other student athletes from Sac State to take a bold step of faith and sign up for the trip.  [#aiatrack](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/aiatrack?source=feed_text) [#track](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/track?source=feed_text) [#MerryinCanary](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/merryincanary?source=feed_text)

Meet Hannah! She ran cross and track at Trevecca Nazarene and is full time staff with FCA at UC-Boulder. She loves running and the opportunities it gives her to build relationships with others. She's looking forward to experiencing the culture of the Canary Islands and to share the love of Jesus with others. Please pray God would prepare her heart and cause all the details to fall in place. She desires the Lord will work through her to bring Him glory and make her a better disicple maker. [#aiatrack](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/aiatrack?source=feed_text) [#track](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/track?source=feed_text) [#MerryinCanary](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/merryincanary?source=feed_text)
