Caitlin, another multi from SFA, is from Alba, Texas.

She is looking forward to joining her two teammates and to grow in their faith together.

"I pray that God works through me in a way that will bring someone to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and that He will open my eyes to all the things He knows I need to see."

As she prepares for the trip, please be praying for safe travels and for confidence that the Lord will use her as she is to influence those who need Him. [#aiatrack](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/aiatrack?source=feed_text) [#track](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/track?source=feed_text) [#MerryinCanary](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/merryincanary?source=feed_text)
