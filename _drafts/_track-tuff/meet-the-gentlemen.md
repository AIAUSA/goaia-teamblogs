Kevin is a native New Yorker, but currently resides in Ohio where he is a sophomore at Cedarville University. When he's not on the track running the 1500m and the steeplechase, he's hitting the Adirondacks for some hiking or skiing!

He joins our Tuff Camp staff and is looking forward to meeting new people and developing new friendships. "I am also looking forward to working one on one with the campers. I have been discipled by older guys and know how much of an impact it can have. So, I am excited to hopefully disciple some kids and help them out."

"I am praying for a heart that is ready and willing to do whatever God needs me to. I think some kids may really just need someone to listen and encourage them, others may need me to call them out or give advice."

He asks for prayers to continue growing closer to the Lord and to keep learning. Pray the campers would come to camp excited and with open hearts and that the Lord helps him discern what is best for each kid.

Dorian is a junior at USC Upstate and he focuses on the 1500/mile and he is joining the Tuff Camp Staff! He enjoys hiking, exploring new places and trying new restaurants.  He is looking forward to making new friends and meeting people who share his two passions - Jesus and running! Tuff camp will be a great place for him to grow in his walk with Christ and an "opportunity to show high school athletes that they are not alone in their struggles with their faith and in their athletic pursuits."  "I’m praying that the Lord reveal to me how much I must rely on Him in my everyday life and in every aspect of my life. And I’m praying He use me and my story to reveal who God really is to people who don’t yet know him."  Please be praying for Dorian as he continues his support raising, that he grows this summer and that the Lord equips him with the spiritual tools needed to help other believers grow in their walks with Christ. And when things get hard with school and training, pray he trusts God and His truths!

Zac will be returning to Tuff Camp for his 8th year. He did 4 years as a camper and this will be his 4th as a counselor. 

"I keep coming back because God amazes me every year with how he uses TUFF to change lives. He takes a group of people with all kinds of spiritual backgrounds, and creates an amazing community that is hungry to grow together and learn what it means to have personal relationship with Jesus. I can't pass up on an opportunity to be a part of a community like that, even if it is just a week. Plus it's pretty fun." 

He is most looking forward to winning the team competition! 

"Last time I checked Vegas had us as the odds on favorite at 7-2." 

This summer Zac will be sharing about the security we have through God. Please pray for him as he finalized those preparations and pray he speaks with confidence and clarity and the Lord gives him the words that will impact the campers.  

Also joining the team are Thomas, Madison, Raine and David.
