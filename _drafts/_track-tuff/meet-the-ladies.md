Bri is a junior at the University of Colorado and she is returning to serve as Tuff Camp Staff!

"Last year was my first TUFF camp experience, and it was awesome. TUFF isn't just a running camp; it is a family. There is so much love and friendship shared between counselors and campers through workouts, Bible studies and our crazy games and shenanigans. I'm going back to build off of the relationships I have formed and to allow God to work through me to help in whatever way I can. And also to get my chance at playing water polo that the staff did not get last year.

"People can be praying for the athletes that are thinking about coming to camp, that they can reach out to friends and teammates that have never been to TUFF, and that everyone who wants to come this year is able to."

We welcome Mikayla to our Tuff Camp Staff! She is looking forward to growing her relationship with God, to be able to display His glory, not just where she lives, and traveling to a new place. She's praying that through this trip, the Lord molds her into someone who can be an example to others at the camp, as well as back home.   
  
"I would like that you guys pray that I stay focused on God as my goal, not get distracted, as well as opening my spiritual eyes and heart to receive everything God has for me. And that I also make sure I show God’s glory, not my own."
