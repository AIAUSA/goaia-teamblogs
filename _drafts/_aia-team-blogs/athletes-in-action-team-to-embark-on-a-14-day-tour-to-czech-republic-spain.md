A combination of 10 NCAA 1 basketball players from across the United States will come together to embark on a 14-day competitive tour of the Czech Republic and Spain.   

The team will conduct a training camp at Baylor May 21-24 and depart the USA May 25 to Prague, Czech Republic.  The AIA team will play two games vs. U20 Czech National Team on May 27 & 28.  On the 29th the team will fly to Madrid, Spain.  The AIA team will play three games vs. pro teams on May 30, June 1 and June 2. The team returns to the United States on June 3.  The goals of this tour are to provide a rich cross-cultural experience for each team member, an opportunity to compete internationally, and for team members to grow in their personal faith. 

 Baylor assistant coach Bill Peterson who spent 7 years serving in the NBA as a coach for the Milwaukee Bucks and Dallas Mavericks is coaching the team.  

“I’m excited to go on this tour to the Czech Republic and Spain with AIA to grow in my faith, to learn and to meet new people. I get the opportunity to play basketball and travel the world, it should be fun.” Lamonte Turner (Tennessee) says about the trip.
