... to bring it all together?

**Where:**  [Athletes in Action Total Athlete Complex](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Athletes+In+Action+Sports+Complex/@39.8647416,-84.9126994,7.71z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfb182e81931c85d9)

**When:**  June 24 - June 30, 2018

The [Ultimate Training Camp](http://www.ultimatetrainingcamp.com/) (UTC) is a high-intensity sports camp that tackles the issue of how to blend faith and sports together in competition.

Historically available only for college and pro athletes, Athletes in Action is partnering with [Cru High School](http://www.cruhighschool.com/) to offer this unique, life-changing opportunity to high school athletes! Participants will learn [five biblical principles](http://www.ultimatetrainingcamp.com/utc-principles) that deal with issues like motivation, attitude, perseverance, winning and losing.

Controlled competitive challenges will engage the athletes in applying what they’ve learned. The UTC will challenge athletes physically, spiritually, and mentally, while developing a leadership framework that will change the way they look at life and competition.
