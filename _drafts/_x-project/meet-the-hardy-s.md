Hi X-Project 2018!! We are the Hardy's and can't wait to meet you! We've been on staff 23 years with 15 of those being in Xenia, OH! Currently, Matt serves as the Great Lakes Regional Director for the Campus Ministry and Sally serves on that team. 

We have 3 kiddos...Ava is 11, Cooper is 9 and Hudson is 6. They love hanging out with college students so get ready! 

In any free time we have, you will find Matt smokin' chains on a disc golf course with some friends and Sally at a coffee shop reading a good book or having lunch with good friends. Together, we love to play tennis and go camping.

We are trusting God for our summer together and get excited to think about how God might want to deepen our love for Him and how He will reveal more of who He has made each of us to be in order to reflect Him to others!
