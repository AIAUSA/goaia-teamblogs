Hi! Welcome to the blog for Athletes in Action X Project 2018!

I'm so excited to tell y'all that we have 35 days until students arrive in Xenia, Ohio for X Project!

You might be wondering what exactly is X Project? Well, let me fill you in on what will be happening here this summer.

X Project is a nine-week internship at AIA headquarters in Xenia, Ohio. This summer internship provides students with the unique experience of working with a sports ministry   
as they get to navigate how their college majors can further missions around the world.

This internship provides students with an opportunity to learn and grow professionally in their areas of study, spiritually in their walk with the Lord, and personally while being a part of a community and cultivating relationships with one another and the AIA staff team.

Throughout the summer, our interns will have the opportunity to get experience in a number of areas from sports/event management and business operations to website content, media and athletic training.

We want to share with family, friends and supporters what God is doing through the lives of our interns during the X Project. Stay connected with us here on the blog, on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/aiaxp/?fref=ts) (Athletes in Action X Project) , and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aiaxp/?hl=en) (@aiaxp) for updates throughout this summer!
