Tim, the director of AIA Track & Field, is returning to St. Moritz, Switzerland for the third year in a row. He is looking forward to, "the opportunity to travel with our project athletes and see them step out in faith to connect with the athletes training there in St. Moritz, which is one the best places for distance runners to train." He asks for prayers for Vinci & Regi Carrillo who are AIA Switzerland staff members as they make preparations to receive a team. Please also pray for spiritually open hearts of the athletes in St. Moritz.
