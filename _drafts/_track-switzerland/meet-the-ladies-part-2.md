Paige was born and raised in Pottsville, PA and this Syracuse senior is joining our Switzerland team! She is looking forward to learn how to more effectively share her faith, especially with younger athletes (she will also be helping with the Tuff Camp!)

"I am excited to share how my faith has changed how I view my sport and how I approach competition. I am also looking forward to meeting the other women on the trip and growing in our faith together. I am praying the Lord will help me step out of my comfort zone and continue to develop the leadership skills necessary to lead people to Him."

As she prepares for the trip, please pray she makes her relationship with God her number one priority daily. Pray she continues to grow so she's ready to serve the Lord this summer.

We are excited to have Sarah, from Western Michigan University, join this team!
