**C.J.'s Staff Role:** He is the Inner City High School Campuses Director for Cru in Indianapolis. He has been married to Anika for 17 years and they have five children.

**My UTC Role:** Emcee and small huddle leader

Why am I excited about the HS UTC? "I'm excited to return to UTC because I enjoy being with athletes. God continues to teach me through sport, and I love watching how He uses the truth of the Gospel in conjunction with sport to change the lives of others. #GetReady #stayready"
