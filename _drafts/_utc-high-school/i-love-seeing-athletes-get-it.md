### Meet the AIA High School UTC Director

![](/uploads/2018/05/01/Erin Wellman Family edit.jpg)

**Erin's Staff Role:** (left) is the Ministry Director for the Sports Complex and Retreat Center in Xenia, OH.

"I work on making sure there are ministry touchpoints happening with the 114,000+ people who come through the sports complex and retreat center each year.  This could be anything from welcoming a group on the property by sharing about Athletes in Action and what we do, to sharing our Biblical principles with groups who are here for an extended period of time.  I also have the privilege of directing the HS UTC for the 4th year in a row.  I work with a team of people for a year to plan and prepare to make this camp experience the best it can be for these high school athletes."

**My UTC Role:**  "I make sure this thing runs."

**Why am I excited about the HS UTC?**  "I am excited to be a part of the UTC because I have seen what God can do in just a weeks time in the lives of these student athletes.  I am always in awe of how He answers the prayers that we have prayed throughout the year for these athletes.  _I love seeing athletes "get it"_.  There are light bulbs that come on during the week that allows them to start seeing how they can worship the Lord through their sport.  That never gets old!  I am honestly praying that myself and our staff work hard to make this the best camp it can be, but that we'd also "get out of the way" and let the Lord do His thing in these athlete's lives."
