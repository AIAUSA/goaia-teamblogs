### Yes, big things are happening at the AIA High School Ultimate Training Camp (UTC).

Do you want to be part of it?

If your not sure listen to Erin, the high school UTC Director, "Take the leap of faith and see what God has in store for you. ... Don't do it alone, bring your friends and teammates so you can continue to apply what you learned at the UTC."
