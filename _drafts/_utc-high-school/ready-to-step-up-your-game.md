**Who:**  High School athletes who aspire to compete on their sport's varsity team or take their game to the next level.

**Where:**  Athletes in Action Total Athlete Complex (Xenia, OH)

**When:**  June 24 - 30, 2018

**What:** The [Ultimate Training Camp (UTC)](http://www.ultimatetrainingcamp.com/) is a high-intensity sports camp that tackles the issue of how to blend faith and sports together in competition.

Historically available only for college and pro athletes, Athletes in Action is partnering with [Cru High School](http://www.cruhighschool.com/) to offer this unique, life-changing opportunity to high school athletes! Participants will learn f[ive biblical principles](http://www.ultimatetrainingcamp.com/utc-principles) that deal with issues like motivation, attitude, perseverance, winning and losing.

Controlled competitive challenges will engage the athletes in applying what they’ve learned. The UTC will challenge athletes physically, spiritually, and mentally, while developing a leadership framework that will change the way they look at life and competition.

**Why?:**

* _“No matter what happens in your sport, you don’t ever lose your relationship with God.”_
* _“No matter what the obstacle, I can persevere because of God.”_
* _“I play for an audience of One.”_

These are just a three responses from athletes who attended a previous High School UTC.
