Staff Role - Ann Arbor Team Leader - High School

UTC Role - Assistant to the Program Director & SPECIAL Coordinator

Why UTC? - I love the UTC!  As an athlete growing up, I never knew the principles the UTC teaches.  I was playing for all the wrong reasons and motivations.  That is why I want to share with these young athletes coming to the camp.  What they will go through at the UTC will change their lives forever!  They will compete at a higher level and experience a new joy and freedom in life and sport.  I can't wait to see what God does in this years athletes.
