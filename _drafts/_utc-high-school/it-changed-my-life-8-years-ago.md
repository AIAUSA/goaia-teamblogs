**Kate's Staff Role:**  Great Lakes Region Operations Director

**Kate's UTC Role:**  "???"

**Why am I excited about the HS UTC?:**  "I'm excited to be part of the high school UTC because God uses the UTC to shape people into fearless worshipers of Jesus through this camp. 

It changed my life eight years ago and made me love God more than ever and at the same time have a passion for my sport like never before. I hope and expect that God will meet all of these high school athletes right where they are and take them further into their faith journey with Jesus."
