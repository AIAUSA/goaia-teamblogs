**Mike & Susan's Staff Role:** Loveland, Ohio High School Director: Campus time coordinator, schedule events as in team talks, Early release parties.

"We connect with students on and off campus developing relationships for the opportunity to share the Gospel and bring students to faith in Christ. This is accomplished through team talks and outreaches to groups and teams. Students are then built up in their faith by bible study groups, mentoring, conferences/retreats to ultimately to empower students to reach their friends and teammates with the Gospel."

**Mike & Susan's UTC Roles:** They will be co leading outreach efforts and huddle leaders.

**Why we are I excited about the HS UTC?** "We are excited to be part of UTC because we know what it has meant in the lives of students in the past. Having a front row seat in seeing that transformation happen over the course of the week will be priceless! We're praying God will use us to shine His love and joy of Christ onto students and other staff even when we're stressed, disappointed, frustrated, etc. To stay focused on Him and His goodness playing for an Audience of One!”
