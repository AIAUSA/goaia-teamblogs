As a high school athlete you are familiar with the buzz and emotion around the game.  However, you know there's much more.  You are preparing lifetime of competition.

**Are you ready to step your game up?**

### **If your answer is yes, consider this:**

### **"Why do you compete?"**

We understand the challenges of competition.  As former high school and college athletes/coaches, our staff team have walked a similar path.

**Erin:**  "There is just something special about coming to the end of yourself and seeing how God will show up. I have been on staff for 12 years and the principles still hit me with truth I need to hear and apply to my life. I got to experience the SPECIAL just a couple of years ago at camp and the Lord showed me the many things I had been fearful of in life (not being accepted, not feeling worthy, not being forgiven, etc) but He also showed me the truth."
