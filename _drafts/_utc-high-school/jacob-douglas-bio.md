### Meet the AIA High School UTC Operations Manager

![](/uploads/2018/05/29/Jacob D HS UTC Bio.jpg)

**Jacob's Staff Role:** Local Team Leader, AIA NorCal, I give direction and leadership to a multi-campus team of 8 staff serving at UC Davis, Sacramento State, University of the Pacific and Sonoma State.

"???"

**My UTC Role:** Coordinate and manage all the equipment/supplies required for all the assemblies and events the athletes run through during the UTC.

**Why am I excited about the HS UTC?** "My life and approach to athletics was dramatically altered at an Athletes in Action Football Camp in Buffalo New York before my Junior Year of High School. I had the opportunity to serve as UTC HS staff two summers ago and it was a blast to see the young men in my discussion group wrestling with finding their identity in Christ and not their sport. I look forward to having the opportunity to see this happen again this summer."
