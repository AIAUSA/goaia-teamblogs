**Our Staff Role:**  Mike and Laurel Riley have been on full-time staff with Cru for over 35 years, mostly with the High School ministry, and more recently with Athletes In Action. They have three married sons and another currently living at home and working nearby.

“Having worked with high school students for so long (most of whom are athletes at our small school), we were very excited to be asked to work with AIA to serve on the 4th Ultimate Training Camp for high school students!

**Why are we excited to be a part of the HS UTC?:**  "We are thrilled to be a part of it again this year, because we have seen first-hand how impactful it can be for these young athletes. Teaching the 5 Principles to teenagers has the potential to not only bring their involvement in sports to the next level in high school, but also to carry on through college and beyond, as these are actually life principles."
