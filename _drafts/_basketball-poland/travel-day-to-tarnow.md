Today was amazing! We woke up and had a Polish breakfast per usual; soft eggs, bread, some type of rice, hot dogs, and deli meat available. We attended International Christian Fellowship of Warsaw Church. It was a very diverse church with believers from all over the world. Our topic was “Fearless” - unlearning fears that are not innate and allowing God to help us overcome those fears. 2 Timothy 1:7 says “For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.” We were created fearless and able to attack/conquer anything life throws at us with the Holy Spirit. And through that victory, we grow spiritually.

Afterwards we had lunch with the church and then traveled to Tarnòw, Poland by train. The 5 hour train ride was filled with joy and spiritual conversation. Both of which we shared and found in in a group of middle school Polish kids traveling on the train as well. AIA intern Kelly Hartwell played a few songs with one of the kids’ guitar, we listened to the young girl play/sing as well; and that opened up conversation for the gospel to be shared with the kids afterwards. They were so sweet!

Our train ride came to an end and we were picked up by a local Tarnòw pastor affiliated with AIA. Our stay will be in his church; which is really much like a bed and breakfast looking house. Our train ride gave me time to reflect on how our God is so incredible, and we are excited to continue to be used as a vessel for His love in Poland!![](/uploads/2018/05/28/38F7704D-2527-4121-9968-254863CD64CF.jpeg)
