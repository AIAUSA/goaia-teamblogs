Today was a great experience for the team. They had the opportunity to play against the women’s basketball team at the prison in Dayton. It was so amazing to see the positive spirits of the inmates we came in contact with and the encouragement they gave us! It was also great to see one of our teammates Sierra, share her testimony at halftime. She reminded us that God is also working and moving through us. Finished up the day with dinner, ice cream, and mini golf. Can’t wait to see Him do more through our girls as we head out to Poland!
