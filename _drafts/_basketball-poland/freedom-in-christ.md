Today was another day full of God's mercy, grace, and guidance! Our team started the day off with a delicious breakfast made by some of our leaders, teammates, and our hostess Eric. After breakfast, we headed to one of the two schools we visited today. We had the opportunity to speak to students about Jesus, how much He loves all of us, and interact with them through basketball drills.

 It was extremely eye-opening to see how excited the children were to see us and talk to us. It is one of my most memorable events about this trips so far - seeing daughters of Christ reaching out with His love. Most importantly, it has been a blessing to see how God has been continually working and transforming my teammates, coaches, and leaders. God's love and Presence truly affects those around us (such as the students we were engaged with today).

 Around mid-morning, our team went on a little walk and learned the history of the Jews and what they experienced during the time of World War II. We even had the chance to see where the first Jews were transported to Auschwitz. Also, we got to see the beautiful, historical buildings and town of Tarnòf...

 The second school we went to involved the same process of engaging the students in our basketball drills and speaking to them about Jesus. At each school, we had a teammate share a little part of their testimony. I pray that God opens the hearts of the students we visited. At the second school, some of the students gave us small gift packages, asked for our autographs, and asked for multiple photos with us. 

 For lunch, we ate Pirogies , which is a traditional Polish meal. In the afternoon, we went over life concept 3, which included a talk about how we can move from our own power and strength to the power and strength of The Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit gives us the power to experience God's amazing plan for each of us. The rest of the afternoon, most people slept. In the evening, we had practice which involved splitting up the students into groups and participating in drills with them. 

 We ended the night with some Polish pizza and Sierra and myself sharing completing our H's (or, our testimonies). After finally sharing my whole testimony for the first time, I feel freed by God's grace, love, and forgiveness. Being surrounded by brothers and sisters in Christ who are all in for The Lord is one of the best feelings ever. Freeing myself into Christ's open arms is honestly the best decision I have made and ever will make in my life. What a beautiful day to be alive!
