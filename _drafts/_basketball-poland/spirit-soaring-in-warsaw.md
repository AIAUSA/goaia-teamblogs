Today we were back in the city of Warsaw and it was the first day of our basketball clinic. The clinic was filled with God’s love, energy, and community. We focused on the subject of “Communication” today so we played some games with the campers to emphasize the importance of communication — not just on the court, but with God and people.

Besides the emphasis on communication, we also worked really hard on he fundamentals of basketball. We had a morning and evening session that focused on individual drill work and team oriented drills. We incorporated “Communication” by having the campers call out names during passing drills and just concentrate on the importance of communicating on the court.

The most breathtaking and overwhelming part of the day, however, happened later in the day when we had a worship session. The team was all together and were all singing our hearts out. It honestly showed how in love and on fire my teammates and staff are for Christ. Half of us were even in tears (including myself)! One of the songs said “I found my life when I laid it down. Upward falling, spirit soaring.” That’s exactly how I felt tonight. Completely surrendered, (happy) tears rolling down my face in awe of God’s love, and my spirit soaring ready to grow in my relationship with the Lord. We stopped midway through the worship session to gather in small groups for prayer and that was another powerful moment. We were all able to share struggles and prayer requests and pray over some of our teammates which was such an amazing experience. I’ve realized being vulnerable to people you care about is such a freeing experience when they pray for your struggles to be taken by God.

The last part of the day was very humbling. The staff brought out buckets of water and rags and told the team they were going to wash our feet — I know how crazy that sounds. But our staff have such servant hearts and they explained how Jesus did the same. He never made Himself seem above another person and we are asked to try to live as close to Him as possible. So as a representation of Jesus and His servant heart, they washed our feet one by one and prayed individually with each of us.

I can’t explain how life-changing, impactful, and humbling tonight was. It grew my faith immensely and drew me closer in fellowship with the people on this tour.
