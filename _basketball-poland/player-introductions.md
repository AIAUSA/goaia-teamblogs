My name is Amanda Fioravanti. I am from Frederick, Maryland. I graduated from Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I graduated in with a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education in 2017. Currently I am working on obtaining my master's degree in Special Education. As you can tell, I love to work with children. Some of my favorite hobbies include giving back to the community and going to the beach! I am super excited to go to Poland. I have never been and am excited to serve and grow my faith there.
