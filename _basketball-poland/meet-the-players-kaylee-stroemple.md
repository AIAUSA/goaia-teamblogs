>  I got involved with a Christian community on campus during my junior year as well as attended the Ultimate Training Camp (UTC), which is affiliated with Athletes in Action. It was at this camp where I truly understood just how powerful sports can be to strengthen and share your faith. I am excited for the opportunity to explore Poland and spread the word to fellow athletes. As well as see how I grow in my own relationship with the Lord. I am beyond excited to be able to do ministry, play basketball, and see the world!
