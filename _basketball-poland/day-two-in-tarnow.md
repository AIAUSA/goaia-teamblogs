Today was day two in Tarnów, and it was filled with God’s overwhelming joy and love. My teammates and I are so blessed to have such a great host named Irek who has helped us prepare delicious breakfasts and dinners. Trying new foods and traditional polish food has been great! Today we tried their dill pickle soup...and despite the name it was delicious!

The first school we visited this morning brought such joy. Interacting with the adults and students is so humbling in the excitement they bring. It is not often that they are able to have a large group of Americans join them and they make the best of it. We got to do some dribbling activities and shooting drills with the students and show how Jesus loves others through our actions since we can’t verbally communicate a lot. I was able to share my testimony with the 1st-3rd graders, which was a great experience and I just pray that God is able to use that little seed I planted to help some of the students grow in their relationship with the Lord. We also signed autographs and received a sweet gift of a mug with chocolate inside!

After we completed two different camps at the first school, we headed to another elementary. Walking everywhere has been a real eye opener and I’m thankful for the steps to help me burn off all the delicious carbs I’ve been consuming! It also makes me realize how simplistic they live here in Poland and are able to enjoy God’s beautifully made creation as they walk from place to place. The second school was kind enough to provide snacks and the kids were full of energy. Coach Thompson shared his testimony and I really felt the Holy Spirit working in the gym. Teachers and students were excited hearing his story.

During the mid-afternoon we had some great team time where we learned about going from unprepared to equipped. This was a great reminder of the importance to stay in God’s word so that in any situation that comes our way we will know how to respond in truth, even though God doesn’t expect us to be perfect in our response He wants us to be equipped. Two more players shared their extended testimony with us and it is so encouraging and to hear the way God works and the desires to serve Him that this team has. Above all else we are meant to spread His word and these are the dreams that this team has for the world.

We played a high school team in the evening and got to make great connections with many of the girls. A large crowd attended to watch and were able to hear another teammates testimony. It’s amazing the number of people that we are able to plant seeds for and I trust that God is going to water those seeds after we leave.

The most amazing moment I have been able to witness on this trip was tonight. After our game  Irek took us all to a river here in Tarnów so that three people could get baptized. Witnessing three baptisms is so powerful and I am so thankful for the way that God has worked on their hearts and where He is going to take three amazing women. I pray that they continuing to experience His grace and love for the rest of their lives. Another fantastic day in Poland...dzien dobry, good day!![](/uploads/2018/05/30/12F5F7F1-4B77-4BDD-8FA0-2167F63F2974.jpeg)
