Early July in Holland, MI is a special time.

This is my fourth year as a counselor at TUFF Camp, and that means I have officially been a TUFF Camp Counselor for more years than a camper. In other words, I'm getting old. 

I first came to camp as a rising Sophomore at Mason (OH) High School in July of 2011. I identify this week as when I truly decided to start following Jesus with my life.

Everything that came after was quite different.

Sport and faith have been intersected in my life since my first week of TUFF. My community in which to share and experience the Gospel has almost always been tied to my time in athletics, specifically with my time in Cross-Country/Track and Field. I have ministered to my teammates, as well as been discipled and mentored by them.

I went to camp two more years, in 2012 and 2013, and then went on to continue my athletic career at Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN. I spent the summer of 2014 in South Africa with _Athletes in Action,_ and then returned to TUFF Camp as a counselor in July of 2015.

Coming back and pouring into the place where I experienced God so clearly was really an incredible experience. Being on the other side as a counselor and helping show the students around me Jesus was such a privilege. It was also amazing to really compare how far I'd grown in all those years, as well as relate to the high schoolers, having been in there exact shoes not so long ago.

More than anything, I was amazed at how not put together camp was behind the scenes. There weren't long board room meetings or super tight rules or even an incredibly detailed plan. We didn't even have a time schedule until recently. I'm not joking. 

The counselors and leaders themselves though, they were actually really normal people. I remembered my counselors being superhuman in my eyes. I started to think maybe we were just a bad batch. 

But I was a counselor in 2016 and 2017 as well, and every year now, still the same thing. Just a bunch of normal, broken people running the show.

I talk about TUFF Camp a lot. I tell people it's the best week of the year for me and that I might actually cry if I ever miss it.

I think what makes TUFF such a special place is that it's really not that special, when you really look at it. There is some honest planning and organization, excellent training and advice, and an unhealthily large amount of fun, to be sure. 

But not much changes year to year. We are doing essentially the same things this year that we were doing way back in 2011. Holland, MI is great, but it's not like we're staying at a resort. There are no really expensive and pretty good speakers. The food is college cafeteria food. The production value is incredibly low. There aren't even fancy lights and fog machines (As a youth pastor, this is still the only week of camp I've been to without fancy lights and fog machines. I don't get it.)

That's why it's the best week of the year. We don't work really hard to make it amazing. We work really hard to make space for God to work, and then get out of the way. 

We know everyone is going to have fun, and that's great. 

We know everyone is going to get good training in and learn about their sport, and that's great. 

We know everyone is going to go home really tired after having an absolutely loaded week, and that's great.

But if everyone walks away from TUFF knowing God more and wanting God more, that's perfection.

I'm returning again in 2018. We've done a good amount of planning, for TUFF Camp standards. But we've done a lot more praying, and hoping.

Here's to another week nobody will want to end.
