The last few days getting prepared for TUFF Camp have been amazing so far. All of the counselors met up at the AIA headquarters in Xenia, Ohio where we got to meet each other and get an insight as to how we were all feeling going into camp. This is my first year coming to TUFF camp, so coming in I was nervous about what to expect, but I can honestly say that the last few days have been so fulfilling and amazing. The counselors and staff have all been so welcoming and open with sharing their backgrounds, journeys with faith, and their struggles as they are all continuing to navigate through the process of being collegiate athletes. 

One of the days we were all on campus, each counselor participated in team building activities at the ropes course in Xenia, where we learned about communication, teamwork, and trust. Completing challenges allowed each one of us to rely on one another to complete difficult tasks, while also understanding how we can use those skills to interact with the campers at TUFF, while also using the Lord to guide us through the next week. It was so helpful to see how God works in every scenario of our lives and puts obstacles in front of us to not only humble us, but to help us face adversity with grace. 

One of the most special moments I have experienced in the last few days though was when all the counselors and staff members met up and went over the “Four H’s” (Heritage, Hero, Highlight, Heartache). This activity allowed me to understand each person so much better as it gave me a glimpse into their spiritual journey and the difficulties they encounter. Going over heartaches was one of the most powerful experiences I have witnessed from this group of people over the last few days. The vulnerability, strength, and bravery each individual had completely blew me away. The stories people had and the adversity they have faced throughout their life made me quickly realize that I am beyond lucky to be surrounded by such strong believers who put God at the center of everything they do. This activity helped put things into perspective for me, as I began to realize how much God works in our lives to challenge us, but to also bring us out of those hard times as better people. After a long time of prayer and loving on one another, I felt so much closer to everyone around me. 

All of the staff and counselors have arrived in Holland Michigan and we have spent the afternoon preparing for the campers to arrive tomorrow. I am getting so excited to meet and interact with so many athletes as we get to train, learn, and grow together. I am already seeing God work in so many ways as the staff members and counselors have been so open and honest with one another. All the preparation for the next week has been coming together nicely, and I know we are all eagerly awaiting the camper’s arrival tomorrow. I can’t wait to watch God’s love multiply over these few days. Stay tuned for more updates as we kick off TUFF Camp 2018!
