June 10th, the day we had all been waiting for had finally come. The team arrived from all corners of the country to convene in Colorado Springs for training camp with great anticipation and excitement. We began to see that God has put together a team to accomplish His purposes in Estonia.

  
Each day of training camp has been busy yet exciting. We have started our days enjoying Godâ€™s creation with a run in the beautiful scenery and thin air of Colorado Springs. Then we would dive into a discussions of the five principle of AIA. These principles have helped us see how our faith and our sport intersect. Throughout training camp we are also learning tools to equip us for our ministry in Estonia. One of these tools is learning how to have an effective testimony which will allow us to share about the hope of Christ we have in our own lives to those we meet in Estonia. Another tool we learned was how to clearly display the Gospel message, so that we will be prepared to share how we can know God personally. 

  
Training camp has also consisted of learning more about the Estonian culture and the opportunity God has presented for us here. We have talked about the history of the country, the food (of course), and how Estonians interact with one another. All of us are very grateful that God has opened a door to minister to the running community and combine both our passion for running and our passion for the Lord. 

Tomorrow we will begin our long journey to Estonia. As we are traveling be in prayer that God would grant us safe and smooth travel. Also, be in prayer that God would open many doors for us to share His gospel to those we meet in Estonia.
