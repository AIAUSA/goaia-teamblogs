Greetings from Tartu, Estonia. This is the second stop on our team’s tour of Estonia. But first let me catch you up on all that has happened in our last few days. As I mentioned in the last post Thursday was the last day of our clinic in Tallinn. This was the day we talked about the “soul” portion of the clinic. Coach Mark and Tiidrek both explained why the spiritual aspect of being a competitor is so important and they also shared about their testimony. During this night of the clinic there was a short athlete panel in which some of the members of the team answered some questions. Those of us who spoke talked about how we place our value and worth in things that are greater than our sport and how we can find satisfaction outside of our success and failures in running. After the theoretical talk we headed outside for a short hill workout.

Friday the team was given the opportunity to go back to the track and meet with the club we met with on Monday. It was a beautiful sunny day and the kids had a great time and got a good workout in. It was great to get to connect one more time with these kids.

Saturday was a travel day. We had a relaxed morning and then drove two and a half hours to Tartu. After we arrived we met Herman & Kristel who lead a college ministry called Agape. Herman & Kristel then took us to the Song Festival which only happens once every four years. It was incredible! Estonian people love singing, and it also has historical significance to them. So, to celebrate they hold a massive concert with hundreds of people on stage singing. It was amazing to be a part of a major holiday here in Estonia.

Sunday was church as usual. This week we attended Tiidrek’s home church Kolgata Baptist. The pastor gave us the opportunity to share about our ministry and how faithful God has been to us. After we shared the church prayed for us as a team. Sunday was also the longest day of the year, here the sun rose at 4am and set close to 11pm. We celebrated with the Church family in the traditional way of a massive bonfire. It was the biggest fire I have ever seen.

Monday was a relaxed day, we spent the day walking around Tartu and planning out the upcoming week.

Tuesday was the first day of the Children’s camp and Coaching Clinic. The morning started at 9:30am and the kids arrived at 10am. We played games, did drills, ran relays and shared a bible story with the kids. It was a lot of fun and most importantly no one got hurt! In the evening we had the first Coaching Clinic is Tartu and it was a big success! We had about 20 people show up. In Tallinn we met in a Sports Clinic and the environment was much more academic. This time in Tartu we are meeting in a Café so the environment is much more relaxed. This meant great conversations long after the clinic was over.
