We have offically made it to South Africa and it is safe to say that God is already doing an amazing work in our team. It has been extremely different for each one of us, but we already know that it is going to be incredible for each one of us indivdually, not only in our relationship with God, but with each other. We would like to take the opportunity to introduce ourselves.

I'm Delelany, one of the athletic training students on the team. Day one started much earlier than the rest of my teammates for this California Girl. Despite two long exhaustuve days of travel, I had the opportunity to spend some serious alone quiet time with God. I had the chance to ask God and prayer for the time in South Africia, that he would reveal to me what he had inteneded for me to learn on this trip. I also was extremely excited to serve in a capacity beyond myself a world away.

I'm Callie, the other athletic training student on this trip. Athletes in Action has already played a part in my family's story and  I can't believe that i get to be part of this opportunity. Our first full day in South Africa allowed us to experience some of the culture and history of this city and nation. We started our day at the District 6 Museum. This area of Capetown was a specific area that was severly impacted by Apartheid; this was a decision by the goverment to seperate the whites, blacks, colors and indians, It is very similiar to our segeration in the United States. Our tour guide Noor lived in District 6 during this time and was forcibily removed from his home and is patiently awaiting his return to District 6. He has helped build the museum with his own picutres. He shared his own personal story and showed  us a glimpse into his life. It impacted all of us. He shared a story of when his son was young and needed to use the restroom, however the only available restroom was one "for whites only." Unfortunately, he had to hold it until he couldn't any longer and use the street. I had to use the restroom tonight, however in the middle of a team debriefing, I did not want to be disruptive and so I held it and waited for over an hour and a half. It was painful and uncomfortable, but in those moments I had a new appreciation for the story Noor shared and I truly began to understand that this was something I have never had to or will never have to experience in the comfort of my life back home, It has been prespective shifting. 

I'm Katie and I'm the other Certified Athletic Trainer rounding out the team. Our second full day here has not only allowed us to become further aquainted with the culture here in South Africa from the local staff in particular, but this spurred a conversation that allowed our whole team to grow closer as we prepare for the athletes' arrival tomorrow. We were real and honest and talked about how much this trip will not only impact us to do something here in Cape Town, but also back home. If there is one thing we can appreciate is that the racial tensions we see prevalent here, are also present back home. It is clear that God intends for us to not just change Cape Town, but to take what we learn and change our world for the better both near and far. As I write this , the laughter of my fellow teammates is erupting from a riviting game of "signs" and it is clear that we will be leaving here with new prespectives and a heart that hurts for our hurting and broken brothers and sisters, but friendships to last a lifetme. 

We can't wait to fill you in on the rest of the story that God is writing, but for now to be continued....
