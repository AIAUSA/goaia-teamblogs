byLine: Eye Opening and Transformative

---
This week has been so eye opening to say the least. We touched down on the history of African Americans, and as an African American woman myself, I feel enraged and fearful of the future. There is discouragement that comes from the fact that there is nothing new under the sun from the generations before us. From the time Europeans began to enslave us to the recent event of Police Injustice a few days ago in Phoenix, Arizona where cops held a family at gun point because their 4-year old stole a baby doll from the dollar store. Although it is frustrating, I am beyond blessed and full of gratefulness that God sent the Holy Spirit to reconcile our group at UP-LA through scriptures regarding the Body of Christ.

For the first time, I realized how significant it is to engage in and maintain relationships with brothers and sisters of other cultures. It is important to let go of any perceived judgments toward one another and dismiss stereotypes in order to truly live out the Gospel that God has laid before us. Michael Sylvester has done an amazing job of displaying the importance of prayer and referring to Scripture as a foundation of standards and expectations of followers of Christ. The staff at UP-LA have done an exceptional job of being available with listening ears to serve us as “counselors” for conflicts in our lives, for discussion about topics we have gone over, for a good laugh, and my favorite part: not having us validate our opinion on things, but continuously challenging us to think deeper than our surface level feelings. As we go into the last week of Project, I can’t help but be excited to witness a change in the atmosphere that can be related to the feeling of a family reunion with my Brothers and Sisters in Christ.
