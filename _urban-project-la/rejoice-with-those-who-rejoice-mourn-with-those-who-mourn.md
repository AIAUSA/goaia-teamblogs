"Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn."  - Romans 12:15

  
Hey everyone, my name is Kyron. I am a junior at Kentucky State University. l also I’m a football player there. My major is Africana studies, and I have a minor in Political Science. I was not expecting to come to LA for the summer.  I was hesitant about joining the Urban Project, but AIA staff member/big brother Brett Nathaniel convinced me to come.   
  
I have been here for two weeks and God is challenging me and making me grow in compassion. One thing that still sticks with me is going to church on Skid Row, and seeing all the homeless people while two blocks away is a thriving community. It’s like they are forgotten about. God tells us so much in the Bible how we’re suppose to care for the homeless and poor. It’s a total different experience when it’s in your face. God has been challenging me about what I can do to help.   
  
Also I love how we all are learning about racial reconciliation here. We have hard discussions, but I feel like they are growing us all. I love how they are open to learning about what we face as minorities. I kind of lost hope before I came here.  I kind of felt like White Christians didn’t care about what we go through at times as Blacks in America. I felt like they were more loyal to America than they were to their Black brothers' and sisters' struggles here. Everyone here has changed my view of this. This experience has helped my faith tremendously, and now I will not make assumptions. I will also learn how to engage with my White brothers and sister about certain issues and be patient with them. I’m so thankful that I am here with amazing people who really love the Lord, and love other people.
