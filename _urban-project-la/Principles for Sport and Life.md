Wow! UPLA has been nothing short of a blessing. From the love you are greeted with when you first touchdown to the house, to the love felt during the multiple, heart-touching prayers everyday; this group of strangers has quickly became a close group of friends all because of the common factor: our love for God. I think being around community where everybody you are around pretty much 24/7, is on a mission to growing their relationship with God is a powerful, powerful feeling that it is hard to explain.

The 5 principles we learned this week are: Audience of 1: Who or what do I worship? (knowing God is the most important audience to perform for), Inside game: What motivates me? (knowing the truth of what God says about you rather than the world’s view), Holy Sweat/Wholly Surrender: How do I grow? (using God and all He has done for us as your power source/motivation), Hurtin’ for Certain: How do I deal with suffering? (Knowing that nothing in the world is not filtered thru God’s loving hands and they are here for our greater good Romans 8:28), and Victory beyond Competition: How do I live for God’s kingdom instead of my kingdom?

I think the most important thing I’ve learned is that these principles apply to competition and sports, but ultimately can be applied daily in our lives. Sports is not the main purpose of our life, but it is apart of many purposes of our lives.

Today we had a “mini-special lab” which is a segmented version of a 20-hour team relay event that encourages us to incorporate the 5 principles we were taught this week in a setting that was physically demanding.

One of the concepts we were taught is that “Rest time is His time”. In a volleyball sense (my sport) this would mean that during serve-receive, time-out, match switches, etc. you put your focus on Him. This morning my “Rest in Him” time was while I was encouraging my teammates during relays as well as in between them. I repeated the verse Romans 8:31 “So what should we say about this? If God is for us, no one can stand against us. And He is with us.” The truth in this verse really came out to me this morning. How blessed, humbled, refreshing, affirming it is to know that I have been chosen to be apart of His Kingdom and to live a new life full of sufferings that in the end become beautiful...it is hard to put in words. It really hit home that there are many, many people out here that are struggling with things, people, mental limitations, physical limitations, situations, downfalls in life that are constantly trying to stop us and make us feel inferior to our passions. The only difference between me and them is that I have been chosen to know that I have a greater good. I know the truth that my loving, forgiving, patient, understanding, all-knowing God is GREATER than anything/anyone the enemy chooses to send against me. Something I struggle with is understanding that “Jesus is the answer, the power, and the savior...I am not.” Knowing this truth helps me to acknowledge how important prayer is and how overlooked and underestimated the power of it is. The biggest thing UPLA has taught me is the power of prayer and I pray that the world learns to understand the power that is found in your prayers, your words, as well as your voice.
