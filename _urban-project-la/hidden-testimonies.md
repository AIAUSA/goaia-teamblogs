Coming to Urban Project – Los Angeles I had no idea what to expect. I knew I would be the odd ball out of the group being the only student that was not a collegiate athlete. How I sneaked my way into being a part of Athletes in Action was my Athletic Training major. Being an athletic training major one is able to see sports from a completely different angle, and there is a rare chance that one gets to see the athletes' points of view.  During the time of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L, I was able to get that perspective. Of course during the first event I got injured and was unable to participate in the rest of it. There I was able to spend time with the athletic trainer and see the other side of what it means to be a collegiate athlete fighting for something that is a huge part of your life. Your sport matters, it’s a part of who you are, it shows your God given talents and gifts. Having the ability to play a sport is a blessing, and we are able to show strength through pushing past hurt, pain, and anger for the goal of glorifying God. I say all this to come to this point. I was wondering what would I, a non-collegiate athlete who did not think athletic training was a part of her future, was doing here at UP-LA. But God always delivers the unthinkable, while being hurt and watching everyone compete God spoke to me and said “you’re suppose to be doing athletic training and you need to take your exam to become certified.” At that moment I fully experienced the saying, "God can use anything to reveal truth to you." There I realized we all have hidden testimonies.

Here at Urban Project – Los Angeles we are getting into topics that most people would not talk about, racial tension, social injustice, the politics behind it all, and how the body of Christ has a responsibility to recognize and act on the injustices happening here in our country and in others. Being a black woman I always thought that my story and my thoughts would be unrecognized and of little importance. But being here in the house with so many different people from all over the country it made me realize that every one of our voices matters. My story matters people want to hear what I have to say. What we think about (race, culture, politics, social injustices) all matters. Coming together as a body and sharing our different thoughts and perspectives is how we can become unified as a body and get closer to the calling that God has for us.

We all have a voice and it is important to speak up and let our voice be heard. There is value, worth and hope in all of our stories and God gave them to us for a reason. Testimonies may be hidden, but they are important and deserve to be told.
