So today in LA was great! We are now on Principle 4, which has been my favorite by far!  We are learning about the 5 AIA principles of sport.Principle 4 is called Hurtin’ For Certain! Basically, it was about trusting and leaning on God in the hard times. To be honest, being that I am not an athlete, I was struggling to relate to the first 3 principles.  However, I learned about how to reset and to remember my focal point in a time of crisis (I had never thought about the different "crises" that occur during a game). My focal point was a rock, and every time I looked at the rock it reminded me that God is my rock and to invite him into my current situation or game. I then went and applied it in the volleyball game, and it truly made a difference in the way I played.  It really helped me to invite God into every game. It has been a great experience so far here in LA and I’m so excited to see what else God has planned these next few weeks!
