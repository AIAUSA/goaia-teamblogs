I am Brooke and I am wrapping up my year-long internship with Athletes in Action (on the Houston team) at the Urban Project- Los Angeles.  Urban Project-Los Angeles (UP-LA) is a 3 week intensive environment where \~50 college students and AIA staff can grow spiritually, intellectually, emotionally, and culturally together as we serve under-resourced communities in Los Angeles.  Together we are exploring injustice, poverty, and racism through listening to thought leaders, watching film, having discussions and visiting museums. At UP-LA, we use the Bible and John Perkin's relocation, reconciliation, redistribution model described in his book _With Justice For All_ as guides for our journey.

We climbed a cliff over the last week and so I am excited to share my experience with you!

_Tolerance= Respect and Acceptance_

Yesterday we went to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. We spent the majority of our time in the Holocaust exhibit. Additionally, we took part in exhibits that caused us to wrestle with the nuances of free and hate speech and the significance of media literacy in the modern technological world. Contrasting the grip sin has on our world in the past and today was unfathomable. Since my initial days at UP-LA, I recognized how powerful propaganda and media is in persuading the masses whether it is in segregation, or Nazi Germany. As Nazi Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels put it, “If you tell a lie often enough people will believe it.” Many ordinary citizens of Germany gradually began to support the annihilation of Jews throughout Europe. As refugees fled for their lives and children were separated from their parents, the majority of countries closed their doors because they did not want to import problems. As I think about the issues we face as Americans, I was challenged to start thinking about to what degree am I complicit in institutional oppression. Even though I may not personally be against a group of people, I am complicit as long as I participate in a system that is.  On the other hand, several ordinary citizens risked their lives and lost them to save and protect Jews.

At the conclusion of our tour, it was an honor to listen to 97-year-old Holocaust survivor.  This survivor talked about how she lived in a 2 bedroom apartment for 2 years with 17 people (in which they argued over food rations by whispering), was captured by the Nazis, separated from her parents and fiancé, taken into a work concentration camp, starved, shaved bald, tattooed, sterilized, finally rescued by Russian soldiers, reunited with her fiancé, immigrated to the US, miraculously had a baby, and was given a second chance at life in Los Angeles.

What a gift of grace to hear her share her story as a member of the last generation that can directly hear from a Holocaust survivor!

Finally, this museum challenged the way I think about groups of people that are different from me. I have noticed that it has been easy for me to dissociate myself from vulnerable people and view them as the enemy, or irresponsible, but in reality I should believe the best in every image-bearer of God.
