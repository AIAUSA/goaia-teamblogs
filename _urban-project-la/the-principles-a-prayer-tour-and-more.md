Today (June 5) was filled with so many rich experiences. It’s incredible to think about what I’m learning in even the most most simple interactions. It’s hard to process because there are just so much deep interactions and activities through out our days.

Today, we learned two more principles. First, we learned about our motivations when we play our sports. A lot of times we are motivated by things like impressing our coaches, awards, hype crowds and fear of failure. However, we learned how unstable those things can be.  We considered some of the following questions. What if your coaches aren’t around, then how hard do you work? What if you don’t get the award? What if there is no crowd? What if you fail? These things are for real. They can crush you, especially when you're around your sport for hours upon hours like we are. We also learned about Biblical truths from God to help combat or fight back against these challenges. We were given various phrases and Bible verses. The phrase I chose was “I am accepted by christ.” No matter what I do, whether I lose the game for my team or win it, God loves me just the same. Wow. How freeing? In this college sports world of intense pressure, we get to play free from that just because I know that God loves me.

Today, God exposed one of the motivations that comes so naturally for me. One of the exercises we did was playing a volleyball game, while everyone was cheering for one team and booing the other. I was picked to play for the team that was booed against. As I hit the ball out of bounds, several times I heard a crowd of people around me booing and talking down on me. Before I continue, remember that they were told to do this for the exercise. Haha! I wanted to cry. I knew it wasn’t even real, but it stung so bad. Because I have a relationship with these people, I wanted them to think I was great.  I wanted them to think that I could win the game, and that I wasn’t going to mess up. I realized how motivated I am by people. I was so motivated by other people to the point that when I disappointed them, I was tearing up.   
What a powerful thing I learned about myself today. It's so incredible to see God showing me and weeding out twisted motivations.

Not only are we learning about oursleves and our sport, but we are also learning about this city. Tonight we took a prayer car ride all over Los Angeles, and it truly was eye opening. There is so much poverty: so much homelessness and much brokenness. It’s hard to see, honestly, but at the same time so encouraging to hear about ministry’s like Homeboy Industries. Homeboy Industries is a ministry that provides support and training for for formerly gang-involved and previously incarcerated men and women. Please help us to continue to pray for the local ministries, because Jesus is the only hope for this city. I’m so thankful for this experience so far, and to be growing here in this city with these people.
