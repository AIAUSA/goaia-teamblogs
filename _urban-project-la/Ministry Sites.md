Every afternoon during the week, we all split up into smaller groups and go to our ministry sites where we get to serve and interact with kids and our AIA partners. The sites include the Boys and Girls Club at Ramona Gardens, Nickerson Gardens, The Ed Center, Pasadena and Faith in Christ. Each of these sites have a different purpose to serving God and the community and I have really enjoyed hearing everyone’s stories from week one. I get the privilege of going to the Boys and Girls Club at Ramona Gardens along with my awesome group members Chris, Eleanor, Imani, and Crosby.

From day one, the staff and kids were so welcoming, and I just knew that we were going to be in for a fun three weeks there. Ages range from kindergarten through high school, and it’s been so cool seeing the dynamics of the place and how the kids look out for each other no matter what age. We spend our afternoons there playing different games and sports with the kids. My favorite activity so far has been staff vs kids dodgeball because the kids are so good and it’s fun to see them work together and play as hard as they can. The kids just finished school this past Friday, so we spent the last two days cleaning up the gym/game room and repainting the floors and walls to help the staff transition into summer. After just one week, I have met some pretty incredible kids who are so funny and full of life. I’m always so excited to go to this site every day because of the kids and my energetic group. I pray that the kids see the love that we have for each other and the joy we feel every time we step into the gym ready to have fun and just be present. Words can’t express how excited I am to see what the next two weeks have in store for us!
