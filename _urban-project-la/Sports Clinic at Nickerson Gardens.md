The Urban Project – Los Angeles (UP-LA) is a life changing experience. I have seen God orchestrating events, conversations, and more since the first day. He is definitely in this place. I am currently serving as a site captain for Nickerson Gardens. This is arguably one of the most challenging sites, but I am loving it. The people there are teaching me so much. I am getting to experience people for who they are and not from what prior stereotypes may have already defined them to be. God is showing Himself so powerfully!  
  
The Nickerson Gardens sports clinic that the UP-LA conducts annually went really well despite the lack of opportunity to properly advertise it. We had basketball, football, kickball, face painting, dance stations, and food for the entire community. We received several positive comments on the power of our presence in their community. It was all God. He loves His people so much. As I go to Nickerson Gardens each day during the week, I am blessed with the opportunity to meet, serve, and commune with different people. I depend entirely on God to show me who to approach and what activities to have available for the kids. There is something special about each visit.   
  
A verse that I have reminded myself of and confessed inwardly and outwardly to my team is 2 Timothy 1:7 which reads, “For God has given us a spirit not of fear, but of power and love and self-control.” With that we obey God with confidence knowing that He is our protector and in control of all things. We trust His wisdom and His voice. I am truly enjoying spreading love to the Nickerson community.
