“Your need is my need” is a phrase that has come up numerous times this first week of project. Relocation, one of the three central themes of Dr. John Perkin’s book, “With Justice For All” (that all project staff and students have read) is all about relocating into any new place to better understand the needs of any community. I truly can’t know what a community needs if I am not living in and with the community.

I grew up here, in South Central Los Angeles, and I still have the sweet opportunity to relocate. My ministry site a housing project in Watts is no more than 3 minutes from my mom’s house where I was born and raised. All that really separates me from the ministry site that I am serving at is a freeway. Although only 3 minutes and a freeway separates the two locations, my life growing up was very different from those that live where I am serving at my ministry site. 

In some ways growing up my needs were not the needs of this community and as a result I had no idea what the needs were within this house project. I had no idea how different my life was from other people pretty much down the street from me. Relocating, coming into this community and serving in whatever way is needed, has helped me to see and understand their needs. And this is why relocation is important. 

The beautiful thing is that we have a prime example of relocation when we think of Jesus. Jesus gave up His privilege, His perfect, problem-free, painless life in heaven, to dwell among people. Through relocating to earth Jesus’ needs became the people’s needs. Jesus, our great high priest, was able to sympathize with us because He Himself endured the life of a human on earth.

When it comes to any community or individual I can’t truly know their needs from a distant, from staying far way. God is showing me time and time again that relocation will cost me but that it is a beautiful cost to pay because it allows me to see, understand, and act, to love, communities and people better. To see, understand, and act in a way that brings justice and dignity to people created in God’s image, all people.
