Today I’m going to talk about what God has done for me in both my life and sport. Before coming here to Urban Project I did not really open up to anyone around me about personal problems.  I didn't have an open heart to share about playing my sport or toward people that were just trying to love on me, and show God's love to me. My personal family is a big support toward me and my walk with Christ.

During the first couple weeks of the Urban Project I had been going through a lot back  home.  I was also dealing with struggles with my left knee. When coming to Urban Project, I wasn’t sure what the people were going to be like. After two weeks passed, I felt at home and had got to know everyone. I could see how much care that they give and the bond that we share is outstanding. One of the moments that stuck out to me was on June 17th when a group of us went to the Drew League game held in Compton.  The Drew League is a basketball League with high level players. That day I walked into the court feeling a little depressed and empty. After a couple quarters of play had passed I was full of excitement, and feeling God's love fill me up like I had never felt before.  The experience made it clear that I needed to start being less closed off and more open hearted.

The Drew League game made me realize how much I love playing for the Lord, and enjoy showing that love for others that surround me.  I was encouraged to keep that faith when surrounded with a community that will be my teammates off the court.  We are a family in Christ.  Sitting and watching the Drew League made me realize that the court is my church.  Even though others were there, I felt like it was just me and God.  He was showing me that I am here for a reason, and letting me know that He has my back, no matter how hard it is for me to be injured and on the sidelines watching others play. Christ showed me that I can still be part of a team by supporting and cheering on the team, and not being upset about my knee injury.  He’s my healer and just have to keep my Faith in Him.

Being at Drew League God had showed me four different injured players.  It hit me hard knowing I am not the only one sitting on the bench seeing the other players out on the court.  They understand the pain and suffering as I did. While there I found myself looking at this random basketball player who had a knee injury as well. For some reason I was actually feeling the players pain like I was meant to feel it. Every time I looked over at him, it made think back to my road to recovery.  To me it felt like God wanted me to be there to see that I am not the only person that suffers from a sport injury. That day God showed me so much in a high school gym in just a couple hours.

Finally,  I know that God brought me here to show me that the Urban Project staff and students are my community and family.  Being here at the Urban Project, I learning a lot from everyone during the various topics that we discuss as a group. As the days pass, I am becoming more open and vulnerable than anything.  I started to open up to everyone here, and felt more comfortable going through the tough discussions. From the beginning, being at the Drew League and being with my Urban Project family made me feel closer to God than ever before in my life.
