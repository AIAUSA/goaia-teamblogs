![](/uploads/2018/06/20/unnamed-7.jpg)Today I’m going to talk about what God has done for me in both my life and sport. Before coming here I did not really open up to anybody that surrounded me when it comes to personal problems or even had an open heart to playing my sport or toward people that were just trying to love on me and show God love to me. My personal family is a big support toward me and my walk with Christ. 

During the first couple weeks of the Urban Projects I had been going through a lot back  home. Then the the struggles with my left knee. While coming to Urban Projects I wasn’t sure what the people were going to be like. Once two weeks passed I felt at home and had got to know everyone and see how much care that they give and the bond that we share is outstanding. One of the moments that had stuck out to me was on June 17th when a group of had went Drew League game held in Compton. That day I had walked into the court feeling a little depressed and empty. When a couple quarters had passed I was full of excitement and feeling Gods love fill me up like I had never felt before and that made it clear that I needed to start being less closed off and open hearted.

The Drew League game  made me realized how much I love playing for the Lord and just showing that exact love for others that surround me in life as well and keeping that faith when surrounded with a community that will be my teammates off the court to call a family in Christ.  While just sitting there watching the Drew League play made me realize that the court is my church and just knowing that others were there but I felt like it was just me and God sitting there showing me that I am here for a reason and letting me know that he has my back no matter how hard it is to be on the sidelines watching others play. Christ was show in me that I can still be part of a team just by supporting and cheering on the team and not being upset about my knee injury that come with because he’s my healer and just have to keep my Faith in him.

Just being there at Drew League God had showed me four different players injured and that hit me hard knowing I am not the only one sitting on the bench seeing the other players out on the court. That they understand the pain and suffering as I did. There I had found myself looking at this random basketball player who had a knee injury as well. For some reason I was actually feeling the players pain like I was meant to. Every time I looked over made look back on my road to recovery. Which to me it felt like God wanted me to be there to see that I am not the only person that suffers from a sport injury. That day God has showed me so much in a high school gym just being there for only a couple of hours with the group.

Finally knowing that God brought me here was to show me that Urban Projects staff and students are my community and family. While just being here at Urban Projects I had learned a lot from everyone and topic that we had discussed as a group. As the days passed I had become more vulnerable then anything and started to open up to all of these people here and felt more comfortable while going through the tough discussions. From the begging to the Drew League made me feel more closer to God then ever before in my life.
