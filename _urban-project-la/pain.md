Today (June 14th) I saw the real life pain and anger like I’ve never seen it before. I had written one entire blog before tonight that I thought I was going to use, but instead I decided to rewrite the whole thing on what I’m trying to grow in from the experiences tonight. The evening started out with an activity called the “Starting Line.”  In the "Starting Line," everyone starts off at one end of the parking lot.  As you answer questions that relate to things that are out of you own control you take steps forward or backwards.  Some of the questions are as follows. “Did your parents get a degree beyond a bachelors degree?” “Were you raised in a two parent home?”  If you answered yes to these questions, then you would take ten steps forward.  On the flip side of if you answer yes to questions such as, “Have you’ve seen an eviction notice?” or “Has someone in your family has been in jail?”, then you take 10 steps back.  After about 15 questions, the gap was the distance of the parking lot. In giving thoughts and responses, people couldn’t hear from side to side much like how in society people can’t hear each other from those two opposing sides either. This shows the responsibility of those at the front end of the parking lot (best situation) to come to those at the other end (worst situation), and hear the people who were born into "lower" positions to feel or relate to their pain. Also, even the people in the middle can play a role relaying the information back and forth because they are close to both ends. 

After this exercise, we went inside for more group discussion, and this is where I saw pain that had turned into anger brought about by the “Starting Line” exercise, and I didn’t know how to handle it.  I would rather just run from it than anything else because I hate tension.  I would prefer to go back to a place where I don’t have to see it (this relates to part of the point that I can choose how much I want to be involved or not in social and racial issues, while the oppressed don't have the same choice).  However, after reading two articles in our binder called “Listening Well as a Person of Privilege: Seek to Understand and Embrace Anger” and “Listening Well as a Person of Privilege: From Pain to Hope” both by Christena Cleveland,  I was more informed about how to handle this situation directly. This article starts by saying that healthy anger is a good thing, because if those privileged can learn to empathize and embrace the anger of those oppressed, then they can encounter a deeper unity as the body of Christ.  Seeking to understand the hurt is the first step. 

Another struggle that I think personally, can be the biggest struggle is not getting defensive just because I don’t view myself as what the oppressed person is referring to as the privileged.  Even though I didn’t personally make the choices my ancestors did, there is more to understand. The thing that there is to understand in this is that these issues are both individual and structural, and I might have unknowingly or knowingly participated in a structure that causes the oppression. Also it is important to remember that some people, especially Christians, are only showing this frustration because they know you care enough to listen to their diverse viewpoints, and it’s them showing how angry they are at the injustice of the world.

 It’s hard to be the privileged person willing to sit and try to understand this frustration, while other privileged people are far off and comfortable. One must also take the anger that the oppressed person feels towards other privileged people as well and attempt to repent of sins committed by the privileged as a whole. The pain in reconciliation is real and not a joke, but this is because as the article states, “ it approximates the work of the cross.” If there isn’t pain and hurt, then it’s not really reconciliation. The reconciliation Jesus went through was so painful He asked God to take it from Him, as it says in Matthew 26:39, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.” There’s still hope in the midst of all of this by the grace of God because, “when reconcilers straddle the pain of the cross and the victory of the resurrection, they encounter an unshakeable hope in the experience of pain.”

Lastly, it is difficult thing for me: I listen and observe those who are experiencing oppression and hurt, then expressing anger and frustration towards systems and privilege, all the while I realize that I may be a symbol of their frustration and hurt – I wrestle with this tension and struggle to find words or actions to engage… how do I help?... what do I do?… what do I do with the conflicting emotions?
