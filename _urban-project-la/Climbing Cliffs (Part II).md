_Economic Reconciliation_

On Wednesday, Mike Gunn, a minister who works in developing countries, spoke on God’s heart for the poor. Economic Reconciliation is not simply about economic equity but economic empowerment. It was interesting to hear that one reason why several poor countries are getting billions of dollars poured into them but see little to no change is because we are sending money and but not helping to develop local businesses to generate more money and production. Gunn shared that when a poor country has a natural disaster, it is helpful to send clothes initially but after a certain period of time, sending too many free clothes disables the textile industry in that country because there is no domestic investment. We must redistribute business skills, time and resources in order to equip people in poverty to produce. Mike Gunn also helped me understand how people in poverty may view the Gospel different than we do. It could be hard for someone to grasp the gospel when they are hungry and just trying to find their next meal. At the same time, people that are poor may have a better understanding of the hope of the gospel than those whose material needs are met since they know that this world is not all there is to offer and that the hope of Jesus is better than anything we have on this earth (Hebrews 10:34-35). 

_A Class Divided_

Wednesday night we watched a film called _A Class Divided,_ in which following the death of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, third grade teacher Jane Elliott led a class exercise to help her all-white class understand racism. _(You can view this documentary online at_ [_https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/class-divided/_](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/class-divided/ "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/class-divided/")_)_ She made all of the brown-eyed kids in her class wear a collar and took away their privileges (no recess, no seconds at lunch, etc.) and gave additional privileges and affirmations to the blue-eyed kids. This exercise lasted two days and on the second day, she switched the collars and biases onto the blue-eyed kids. As the kids who were discriminated against became the kids who were affirmed, their countenances and performances drastically changed. For example, the kids performed lower on their math problems when they wore the collars compared to when they didn’t. The results of this exercise are incredibly profound and the injustice that this exercise exposes still takes place in our world today. When an authority figure, such as a teacher or coach, degrades you, you can speak out against them but then they can use your resistance to further degrade you for not following the rules and being a "rebel." Going through this type of oppression is exhausting and I understand why the tender minds of young people eventually believe it when a teacher says that they will not amount to anything or an institution as a whole makes this statement.

As this 3 week long journey comes to an end, these days have been a climax for me. I am excited to keep processing this stuff when I get back home and for the years to come. I am incredibly grateful for the people that have become family along this journey and for a deeper understanding of the Gospel that happened for me during the Urban Project- Los Angeles
