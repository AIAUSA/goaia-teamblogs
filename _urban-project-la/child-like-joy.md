Hi! Today I’m going to talk about my experience at beach day. We took about 30 kids to the beach on Saturday (June 16), and it was one of the best experiences I have had in a long time. The kids looked so happy and joyful, and it was so beautiful to see. Some of these kids have lived in California their entire lives, and have never been to the beach. Everyone was playing and having a really great time. My favorite part of the day was the soccer game we played in the sand. One of the boys on my team scored a goal and the excitement in his face was something I haven’t seen in a while! It is something that I have wanted for such a long time.

   
Seeing this young boy's face was the perfect image of innocence and Christ’s love. Being around these kids everyday at the Boys and Girls Club, and then at the beach brought Matthew 18:3 to my mind.  Mathew 18:3 reads, “I tell you the truth, unless you turn from your sins and become like little children, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.” Playing soccer in college has had its ups and downs for me. Being at Urban Project - Los Angeles, I have learned that my identity cannot be found in my sport, but in God. I am a child of God. Sometime in sports, I do not act like a child of God. Rather there is a lot of frustration and brokenness that goes into plying soccer. So reading this verse reminds me to be a better teammate and act like a child of God, obtaining pure joy like the kids at the beach.

   
So to wrap it up, working with the children in Los Angeles has taught me so much. Some of the kids, that we get to hang out with and serve, don’t have a lot and live in rough areas.  However, they still have so much joy and love in them, and its truly one of the most inspiring things to me.  Many times I take things in my life for granted, so through this experience, I’m learning to appreciate everything that I have. I’ve loved every moment of my time in Los Angeles, and I can’t wait to see what else God has in store for me here and beyond.
