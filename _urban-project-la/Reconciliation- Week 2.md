byLine: 'Reconciliation- Week 2 '

---
The Urban Project – Los Angeles has pushed me outside my comfort zone and challenged me intellectually and spiritually in ways I wasn’t expecting to endure this summer.

It’s our second week here, and each day has been packed full of films, discussions, incredible speakers, and activities centered around Dr. Perkins' second R, Reconciliation. As we talk about Reconciliation, we have continued dialoguing about race, culture, wealth, and due to America’s history of oppression, the unjust advantages that whites have over minorities. Before coming to UP-LA, I had never witnessed my privilege as a white woman firsthand, but only saw the unjust acts occurring on the news and in my school until I saw it with my own eyes here in LA. It was never a reality for me until the moment I arrived at this Project. Never before this trip had I walked around an area like Skid Row, (or even heard about Skid Row), to see tents lined up on sidewalks, and people sleeping on the side of the road and on benches during the daytime because it’s too dangerous to sleep at night. Never before had I realized the impact that my ignorance had on the world. And, never before had my eyes opened to how my privilege gave me the ability to turn a blind eye to things I didn’t want to see.

This morning before we dispatched to our different ministry sites for the day we did a privilege walk activity called Starting Line. This is a way for people to recognize how power and privileges can affect our lives, even when we don’t even know that it’s happening. By the end of the exercise there were feelings of discomfort that settled with me. There was a big gap between those that made it all the way to the end of the parking lot and those that didn’t take many steps at all. I wrestled with what I can personally do to help those who aren’t on the same line as me. I realize that I will never fully understand what it is like to be underprivileged, but I do know that by living out God’s word and by moving toward those who are in need, while also not expecting people to meet me halfway, I can contribute by moving alongside my other brother and sisters in Christ. Because, no matter where somebody is in life, at the end of the day we are all loved by the same God, Jesus Christ, who loves us for who we are and not what we have.

“Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, urge you to live worthy of the calling you have received, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit -- just as you were called to one hope at your calling – one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all.”

Ephesians 4:1-6 (NASB)
