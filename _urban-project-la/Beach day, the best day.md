byLine: Beach day, the best day

---
Hi this is Emery,

Saturday the UP-LA went to the beach at Playa Del Rey. But we didn't just go to the beach to play (though we did plenty of that), we went to the beach with lots of the kids from the ministry sites students have been working with the last two weeks. All of the kids were hanging out with all of the students. It was so nice when I saw everyone smiling with joy on their faces. Something that made me laugh was when a lot of the kids were playing in the waves with the students in the water. The water was so cold, but it didn’t bother the kids as long as they were having fun. There was a lot of that happening – playing frisbee, jumping in the waves, building sand castles, kids burying students, and even looking for shells. For lunch we had hot dogs, chips, and fruit punch or water. All the kids were eager to get back in the water, so once lunch was over and waited a few minutes later we were back in the waves. That was an amazing Beach Day!!! When beach day was over we all got in the vans and took the kids back to the sites. It was amazing seeing how much fun was had by the kids and the number of new friendships the students have made even with kids from other ministry sites. Anyway Beach Day filled my heart. It was the best day!!!!
