byLine: Grateful to Serve

---
> Hey Everyone!
>
> When I think of the Urban Project – Los Angeles, the word thankfulness comes to mind, just as the pastor on the corner church in Skid Row preached about Sunday morning –  thankfulness and a heart full of gratitude. We have been challenged to face the various different oppressions and injustices throughout Los Angeles. Instead of being like an ostrich and hiding our heads in the sand, we, as Jesus followers, have the chance to face it. We have the opportunity to meet people where they are and serve them... with the biggest smiles on our faces and hearts that are ready to fulfill the mission of the kingdom. And that is by the grace of God and I am so thankful for that chance. We have heard God calling for obedience. Through obedience in following God’s call to serve on and with this Project, I, as well as the rest of us, are grateful for the people we are going to learn from: the staff, the interns, our ministry leaders, and the individuals that we will be serving.

> Monday we started our mission work at Thrive in Pasadena, CA, with beautiful and bright children of all different ages. We, as a group (Sasha, Natalie, Kate, and I), have been challenged to see what we cannot see and hear what we cannot hear... to dive into this community and let God work through us and reveal our true purposes of being at this specific site. I am excited to see where these next three weeks take us. I’m especially excited to see how our site director influences and molds our minds just through hearing her testimony and hearing about the community work she partakes in everyday.

> I ask that everyone pray that we are not just going through the motions of being grateful, just as we do when we say please and thank you. But instead, that we are truly thankful for everything, every situation, and every person we cross paths with. I pray that we go into each day with an open heart and open mind to dive into the community and do the work that God has called us to do.
