Hey everybody! My name is Kori and I‚Äôm on the rowing team at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Today we began learning the classic AIA principles. Simply put, they are five principals that in sports terms explain how we can use our sport to glorify God. After a great teaching by Gabby, we ‚Äúwent to church‚Äù at the local park to worship God through volleyball competitions. It felt great to play with such freedom knowing that everyone was playing for the same goal: God‚Äôs glory.

Today also happened to be the first day of our work at a ministry site. I helping out with a local boys and girls club in the area. Honestly when they told me I was going to be working with kids I was VERY apprehensive. I‚Äôve never seen myself as a ‚Äúkid person‚Äù before but I know that it is in uncomfortable situations where God grows us. So trying to be open minded, I ended up having a blast playing with the kids! They kicked my butt in basketball, dodgeball, and running races on the basketball court. I know that God has put me into this ministry sight for a reason and I‚Äôm praying that God will be glorified as I continue spending time with the staff, serving alongside my team, and getting beat in other sports by the kids!

These past two days have felt so long but the conversations, experiences, and relationships that God is beginning to form on this trip is so exciting! (hence the picture above!). Although I am very mentally and physically tired, I am so thankful for this opportunity to grow in my own faith and fellowship with those around me.

Prayers and peace!¬†ü§ôüèª
