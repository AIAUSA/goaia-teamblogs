As I write, there are only about 48 hours left of Urban Project - Los Angeles. The past three weeks have been both challenge and joy, both difficult and immensely rewarding. Throughout this project we have talked about prevalent issues of racism, privilege, poverty, and justice. We have struggled with how the church should handle these things and how Jesus speaks into them, giving us both hope and perspective. This morning we took a step back to reflect on project and then watched the 2008 film Gran Torino.

If you have not seen Gran Torino, a film directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, it tells the tale of Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), a retired Korean war veteran whose Detroit neighborhood gradually goes from being all white to being composed almost exclusively of Hmong-American immigrants. As the film progresses, Kowalski and his neighbors, initially at odds and seemingly worlds apart, come to share each otherâ€™s struggles and realize what they have in common. With rich echoes of the gospel (spoiler alert!), Kowalski learns to love his neighbors even to the point of laying down his life for them.

As someone from the Midwest (Wisconsin), the film struck a chord with many of my own experiences. Growing up in a largely white environment with a white father and a half-Korean mother, I have been able to glimpse pieces of both white and Korean cultures and their similarities and differences. While these cultural differences and even the prejudices that often spring from them can threaten to tear us apart, the church stands poised to play a key role in bringing us back together. The gospel holds the key to racial reconciliation. Just as Jews and Gentiles were united through the cross of Christ in the early church (Ephesians 2:11-22), so also the Holy Spirit can bring reconciliation today.

The difficult thing is that reconciliation, as this project has taught us, is virtually always a fight. We must fight our own internal prejudices, be willing to listen to the opinions of others, bear the hurts of others, and endure the struggle for unity. Yet this project has also given us a glimpse, however small, of how good unity is. It has been a privilege to converse with and listen to my brothers and sisters of many different ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, and familial experiences while on this project. I have learned much and hope to take what I have learned back into my own regular day to day life. There remains much hurt in the world, much injustice, and much oppression, but Jesus cares about it all. Through this project, he has been teaching me to care more as well, and helping me see ways that the church can truly be the light of the world that it is called to be.
