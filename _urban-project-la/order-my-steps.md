Hello readers!  My name is Nola Grace and I am currently studying Exercise & Sports Science with a concentration in Health & Wellness at Meredith College in Raleigh, NC.  As an aspiring Physical Therapist and a daughter of the King, it has been a goal of mine to integrate my two loves of serving athletes and serving the Lord.  This summer, I knew I wanted to gain experiences that combined these two passions and helped me learn how to be an intentional Christian in the world of health professions.  

After a great deal of research, I discovered the Sports Performance branch of Athletes in Action, and fell in love with the idea of a summer mission to Honduras, where I could assist Physical Therapists and other health professionals, while spreading the Good News of the Gospel.  

In the first week of March I committed to join this trip, and from the moment of my acceptance through the next three months, I was preparing to go to Honduras, continuing in-depth research on the program, and raising support for the large trip ahead of me.   

Today (June 10th) was supposed to be the day that I was to arrive in Honduras with this mission team.  However, God had a different plan for me. 

With less than a month before my departure, I discovered that the trip would not take place.  I was constantly being reminded from friends, family, and supporters that God was in control, and that He knew the reason for why that trip fell through, but that was so hard for me to understand––especially because I was so incredibly excited for it.  I was truly devastated because I was sure that the Lord called me to serve Him this summer, and I was so desperate to fulfill that calling and join in His mission.  

In the few days after I received the sad news, I stayed in contact with AIA staff to explore what other options I might have for my summer.  An email was returned to me with a list of dates and initials of trips (initials of which I did not know the meanings).  After a ten minute phone call with an AIA staff member who _briefly_ (and I mean _very briefly_) explained to me what these initials meant, I (very spontaneously) committed to joining the Urban Project - Los Angeles trip as one of the onsite Athletic Trainers.  Even though I knew remarkably little about what I had just signed up for, I was SO excited to be joining a new team and seeing the Lord work––and I committed less than two weeks ahead of my required arrival in LA.  And, boy, I had no idea what I was in for!  If you have been following along with the rest of this blog, you know that this first week alone has been full of intense physical, mental, and spiritual challenges.  Each of these has provided an incredible learning experience––far beyond what I could have imagined going through.  Specifically, in the S.P.E.C.I.A.L., it was so remarkable and encouraging to see the lesson on the AIA Principle #5 (“Victory Beyond Competition”) come to light.  The lesson teaches us to use the awesome gifts and talents the Lord has blessed us with in every area of our lives in order to give the glory back to Him.  With each of us being very unique and individualized children of His, we are all blessed with wildly different gifts.  It was so amazing to witness each of these areas of strength reveal themselves in every athlete through the S.P.E.C.I.A.L.  They came out in a way that proved that not one person can do it all––we must rely on other people and their strengths as well to come together as one strong whole.  This, I believe is a true testament to the power of the body of Christ and how we must rely on our brothers and sisters in order to truly see strides and successes for the Kingdom of God.  

While I know either experience (UP-LA or Honduras) would have been fantastic, I have no way of knowing what that other trip may or may not have brought.  All that I know is this: through this experience that the Lord so beautifully placed before me, I gained remarkable experience in my field, learned from some of the wisest and most incredible people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing, made some of the strongest forever-friends, been boldly pushed to step out in my faith, experienced the strong and true power of prayer, witnessed some of the realest testaments to the Lords goodness and reliances on His Truths, become a part of a family of believers who deeply value integrating sport and faith, and had my eyes opened to entirely new ways of serving Him in sport and life, near and far.
