It is finished! The final round of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L concluded today for myself and my brothers and sisters. It was 20 hours of near constant sweat and surrender.   
  
We will have life changing stories from experience, no one walks away the same. And, I’m grateful I get to share mine.   
  
My life has been made up of competition: years upon years of training and conditioning. I have poured my blood, sweat, and tears into it, but never my heart. I have never been required to do so. Now the S.P.E.C.I.A.L for all it brings (believe me it brings plenty.) is not the hardest thing I’ve undertaken physically. But, it is the hardest thing I’ve done whole heartedly, and has pressed upon me the importance of a team and support system in the way nothing ever has.  We started the S.P.E.C.I.A.L with relay races. I pulled my hamstring in the first hundred meter sprint. Immediately my ability to run was halved. And with it, my ability to undertake my fair share of relays and events much less my ability to take on my teammates portions, should they falter.   
For perhaps the first time in my life I was utterly dependent on others to even stay in competition. I was relying on others to carry my way. And let broke my heart was they did.   
  
As broken as I was they saw me through every event with only love and encouragement in response to failure. Which ultimately became success as there support pushed me safely through the pain.  
That’s when the parallel was revealed. God’s been caring my way for a long time. And I’ve never realized it.   
He sent his son to be crucified, sentencing him to death so that he could promise me life.  
And regardless of my imperfection, efforts, successes and failures. He will never stop carrying me.  
Which is perfect, because I’ll never stop needing him to.
