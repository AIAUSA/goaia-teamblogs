What a great first week in Xenia! Immediately upon arriving, we met each other and spent the day in orientation, exploring AIA’s campus. After being assigned our intern teams, we made tracks all throughout Xenia on an “AIA-mazing Race.” The race was on to beat the clock, with 12 different stops all around the town within an hour.

Saturday morning was filled with more team-building events, this time focused on guiding each other through obstacles. AIA has a challenge course, with multiple low-course obstacles including a “ravine,” a “wild-woozy,” and a 12-foot wall. Our task was to think critically with each other to figure out how to get through the obstacles and complete the challenge in a limited amount of time.

A highlight for a lot of the interns, myself included, was when we overcame the wall. We managed to hoist everyone except for the last person, Lindsey, up the wall. At the beginning of the challenge, we had come up with a plan we thought would work for getting her up the wall, since no one was left to give her a boost. Unfortunately, when Lindsey was the only person left on the ground, the plan didn’t work. She couldn’t jump high enough to reach Matt and Malik’s outstretched hands. At her highest point, 8 inches still separated their fingertips. A quest ensued for a better plan, one that would still allow us to finish the course. Debbie, the instructor, jumped in with a suggestion: put on a harness, have someone climb halfway up the wall, and let Lindsey climb over the first person then help the first person up. After deliberation, Matt volunteered to be the middle man. We hoisted him up onto the wall and he grabbed ahold of the top, anchoring himself and allowing Lindsey to then climb up over him.

After we finished the course, we gathered for a debrief time, when the situation at the wall was brought up. There was no way, on our own knowledge and ability, that Lindsey could have gotten up the wall. Debbie provided insight because she knew the only way it would work for Lindsey to get over the wall; in a way, Debbie was representing God in the situation. She knew the only way Lindsey was going to get over the wall was by sending Matt down from the top of the wall to hang in the balance. Matt depicted Christ, sacrificing his own position at the top of the wall to come back down and provide Lindsey a way to the top. **I think all of us at that moment were drawn into the physical representation of the Gospel we had just witnessed.**

Team-building and fear-conquering activities continued Saturday afternoon, as we attempted high-ropes course with a partner. Some were more courageous than others, balancing on ropes and bridges 40 feet in the air. Over all, the first weekend at X-Project was a blast, providing us ample opportunity to get into our “growth zone” and be challenged physically and spiritually.

Monday marked the start of a full week of training, beginning with learning AIA Principle 1: Audience of One. After teaching and discussion, we applied the principle through volleyball, competing with the remembrance that we are playing with God, not for a crowd or for approval. Discipleship groups followed, giving each of us a chance to digest and discuss everything we had been taught and applying. Tuesday we met with our supervisors and had orientation into our individual jobs for the summer. As an athletic training intern, I get to work with the Xenia Scouts baseball team along with three other interns: Cassi, Ali, and Janell. It’s so cool how God works, bringing together the four of us, three of whom are from the Dakotas and two of whom attend the same school. After Wednesday morning, we realized three of the four of us have the same top strength in common (according to StrengthsFinders). I am excited to see how that will play out within our sports medicine team this summer! The rest of the week was spent at a retreat center, learning Principles 2, Inside Game, and 3, Holy Sweat/Wholly Surrender, and spending time going over the book GodSpace. Saturday we went out into the community to practice creating GodSpace and having conversations with people we met. That brings us to this week, when we will dive into the “office” portion of our internship and begin meeting the athletes we are working with.

I think I speak for all the sports medicine interns when I say it is such a blessing to be immersed in a culture where faith, action, and sports medicine collide. I am super excited to be challenged and encouraged this summer. Even outside of our sports medicine team, the depth of friendships created in the short time we interns have known each other is a testament to the family of God. Immediately, I felt welcomed and was brought into a community of Christ-followers committed to making the Gospel known in every team, every sport, and every nation.
