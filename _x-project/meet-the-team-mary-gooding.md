Hey everybody, my name is Mary Gooding! I graduated from Purdue in Organizational Leadership and Supervision. I also played softball while I was there! This is my first year on staff with AIA, and I am on campus staff at Indiana University (my rival school...I never thought that I would be caught in anything Indiana, but here I am wearing an IU sweatshirt in my picture)! 

I love sports, but I also really love spending time with my family. I am the youngest of six and all of my siblings are married and have several kids! I absolutely love being an aunt! Besides playing with my nieces and nephews, on a nice day you will typically find me hammocking! 

I am so excited for this summer and to meet all of the interns! I am excited to walk alongside them and equip them to follow the Lord and make disciples as they go into the work force and back onto their campuses.
