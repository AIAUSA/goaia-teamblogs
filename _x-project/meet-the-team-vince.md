Hi, my name is Vince and my wife is Karen. This is my 32nd year on staff with with Cru and I am on AIA staff at our World Training Complex and Retreat Center. I serve as a Sports Team recruiter and a mentor and coach to our staff.  
  
Karen and I have been married for 31 years and have 3 adult children as Karen mentioned in her post.  
  
We have been blessed with a grandson named Eli. He is 9 months old. We are catching some Zâ€™s together.

I love to fish and watch Lebron James play basketball!  
  
I am really excited to be part of your lives as you come to Xenia and encourage you in your faith journey.
