My name is Karen Purpero!  I'm so excited to meet all of you!  I've been praying for you! :-}

Vince and I have been married for 31 years, I came on staff with Cru in 1987, we served with the high school ministry here in the States as well as 9 years in Italy and Germany until a year and a half ago when we joined with AIA.  My role here is serving with the new staff and interns, and of course I keep Vince in line.

I am an introvert but I love one-on-one time or small groups.  I have a passion for seeing people flourish using their unique gifts.  I am a classical pianist and I give evangelistic concerts using the music to share a message. Cru is an amazing organization that champions our staff finding creative ways to serve!

We have 3 kids:  Ellyn is 27; she and her husband David Clayton are on staff with Cru Campus at Purdue.  They gave us our first grandchild, Eli, he is 7 months old and adorable.  Anthony is 24 and he is raising his support to join us here with AIA in Xenia.  You will meet him, he's a hoot and a half.  Chloe is 23, just graduated from Appalachian State with a degree in Studio art / painting.  She and her fiancé Gabriel will get married in NC in May! 

I like a hodgepodge of things:  music and art, reading, all kinds of needlework, and getting dirty out in the garden.  Flowers.  I leave the vegetable gardening to the local farmers.  A fun fact about me....I can ride a unicycle.

I'm really looking forward to having you all at our home in the country - we have 4 acres and chickens.  And I can't wait to see how the Lord works in all of your lives this summer as He continues to reveal His perfect plan for you!
