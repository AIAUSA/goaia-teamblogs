My name is Kelly and it's my honor to serve as the Director for X Project. As the oldest momma in this family photo, you can see that doing life with 20-something's is a big part of my current reality. Serving in this role affords me the blessing of "adopting" additional 20-somethings to walk with through this significant and familiar season.

My husband and I followed God's calling to Athletes in Action in mid-career and moved to Xenia about 14 years ago... part of the Sports T.E.A.M. division. In addition to directing X Project, we are devoted to serving coaches and athletes and their families primarily through the men's basketball department. God keeps showing up in remarkable ways... drawing people to Himself and changing lives through the platform of sport... and we are thrilled to be a part!

One of my traditional hobbies is digging in the dirt -- planting and transplanting -- watching things grow, die, and grow again (gardening). Less traditionally, I relish (1) doing something I've never done before and (2) celebrating when I'm not in a hurry... like sitting down for dinner with others who are unhurried, enjoying conversation and maybe even an after-dinner game or walk.

As X Project draws near, I look forward to encouraging our interns to discover and embrace their uniquely-designed-by-God selves, step into growth zones, understand how we are better together and, ultimately, be overwhelmed with the mercy, grace and love of God... bringing Him glory all the days of their lives!
