It all began with a question I had for God: _What do you want me to surrender?_ As if in a vision of fire like that of the burning bush, the reply came: _Everything_. I have to be honest, though. Even after that dramatic interaction with God, He had to drag me to where He wanted me to be. Though I had no idea what I would be doing this summer, I didn’t imagine it would be an X Project internship. I’ll go ahead and spoil the ending, however, because I am beyond grateful to be here.

But first let me introduce myself. My names is Josiah. At Cincinnati Christian University where I attend, I am a Biblical Studies student and a Residential Assistant, or RA. I love my school and my community there, and am excited to start my senior year this fall. Originally, however, I am from Hawaii. I was born and raised on Oahu but my family recently moved to Ohio. The transition from having two seasons in Hawaii--rainy season and sunny season--to the dynamic and unpredictable seasons of the Midwest has been rough at times, but I enjoy my second home here. 

As spring semester approached its end, I began to evaluate my options for summer. Many options vied for my attention this summer, from camps to jobs that could potentially make me a lot of money. But God called me to follow Him. This is when I began to drag my feet, because my pride told me I could make a better plan than God. Nevertheless, I gave up my plans and I applied for X Project.

After only two-and-a-half weeks in, I am convinced that my plans would never have been as good as God’s. It’s shocking how evident it is that God called me to be here, and how everything I’m learning lines up perfectly with what I need. That’s not even to mention how happy I am here. I spend most of my time outside working on the Challenge Course as an assistant facilitator. This means I get to see the beauty of physical challenges leading people to discover deeper realities about themselves or their situation. It’s also teaching me a lot. 

Being an RA means I’m always in a leadership position when school is in session, and helping at the challenge course means I consistently get to practice leadership skills. This could mean taking charge of groups of middle schoolers, business professionals, or anything in between. I already have gained skills that I know will benefit my floor when I get back to school. Beyond being an RA, however, I’ve always been involved with ministries at my local church, and everything I’m learning will also apply to that.

The challenge course also collides with the spiritual aspect of X Project. As previously mentioned, this was a turning point in my life. It is not to say that I did not have a relationship with God before X Project, but I knew that He was calling me to take the next step in my journey with Him. X Project has been that next step. Between being mentored, taught principles for life, and having deep, authentic fellowship with other believers, I am being spiritually built up in ways I never have been before. 

	The rest of my time here could be spent building on what I’ve already been learning and I would be completely satisfied. But I know there is still more to learn, more experiences to share, more memories to be made. I know I’ll continue to be mentored in a way that teaches me how to become a mentor to someone else. I’ll continue to grow awesome friendships, complete with inside jokes and shared lessons. This will be a summer I’ll always remember. 

	When God asked me to surrender everything, I didn’t expect to get so much in return. But that’s the thing about God, He’s always breaking one’s expectations. I couldn’t be happier that He brought me here, and this lesson of surrender is one that changes how I am living. So here’s to God breaking our expectations and taking us on adventures we never saw coming!
