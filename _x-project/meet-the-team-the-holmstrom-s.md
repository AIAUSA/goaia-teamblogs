We are the Holmstroms. As of December 2, 2017, we became a family of 3 as we welcomed the birth of our first son, Kyson.

Jenny loves to be outside and would love for you to ask her to go for a walk. She is also the world's best mother... I'm not biased or anything. Jenny attended North Central University in Minneapolis, MN, where she studied Communications.

My name is Kyle, and I played baseballÂ at Lenoir-Rhyne University in Hickory, NC, where I studied Sport Management. My favorite sports teams are the Chicago Cubs and the Green Bay Packers.

We have been on staff since September of 2016 and live in Xenia, OH, where we work with the Sports Complex and Retreat Center. Some of our favorite TV shows include How I Met Your Mother, Friends, and Parks and Rec.

Last fun fact... Jenny and I met during the summer of 2013 at X-project... crazy... so we are pretty excited about being a part of the next chapter of this amazing internship! We are most excited about the opportunity for the interns to grow personally, professionally, and spiritually, and we are honored to play a small role in that development.
