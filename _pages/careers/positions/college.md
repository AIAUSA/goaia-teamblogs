There&rsquo;s pressure to perform in order to earn playing time or a spot on the team<span class="s1"> </span>or to simply keep a scholarship. Between classes, practice and traveling to compete, it&rsquo;s hard to find time to get to church or a Bible study. Sometimes their unique status as an NCAA athlete can even make it hard to know who can be trusted.&nbsp;</p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p2">But in the face of these challenges, God is drawing many athletes to Himself. As more athletes discover the freedom of playing for God, lives are changed.</p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p2">That&rsquo;s why we need you. You can be a part of the bigger story God is writing by being the person who engages with these athletes emotionally, intellectually and spiritually within their campus environment. From a college campus (your placement will be based on your preferences and ministry needs), you can help change the world by equipping athletes and coaches to use their unique influence to share the gospel with others.</p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p2">Could you be the person to step into these crucial roles?</p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p3"></p><h2 class="p2">Campus Field Staff</h2><p class="p3"></p><p class="p2">Campus Field Staff work alongside athletes and coaches on college campuses to help them grow in their faith.
