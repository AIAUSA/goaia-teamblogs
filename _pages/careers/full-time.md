<h1>Full-Time Applicants</h1><h2 class="p2">Qualifications</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><p class="p3"><img src="/uploads/careers/NewStaff2010-web.jpg" alt="" p="" class="img-responsive pull-right col-md-5" /><span style="font-size: 13px;">Because AIA is a faith-based organization, potential staff members must meet unique qualifications. Learn more <a href="/careers/qualifications">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Married with Non-Staff Spouse</h2><p>Historically, it has been Cru&rsquo;s policy to accept both husband and wife to serve concurrently as missionary staff members based on God&rsquo;s calling them as a couple to our ministry. In 2014, Cru made the decision to allow individuals to join us without their spouses. We want to encourage a culture where all staff members are fully surrendered to and following God&rsquo;s calling, even if it means that one spouse is called to serve in a different vocation. Because of this policy change it is very important that you are aware of all the implications of this employment status <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span></strong> you apply.</p><p><a href="/careers/married-individual-applicants"><strong>Click here</strong></a> for all the important information regarding this new category and to access the Pre-Application Questionnaire. A <strong>Pre-Application Questionnaire is required</strong> before you begin the application process for this new staff category. </p><h2 class="p1">New Staff Training (NST) Options</h2><p>Cru New Staff Training includes 2 parts: Part 1:&nbsp;<strong>Institute of Biblical Studies (IBS);&nbsp;</strong>Part 2:&nbsp;<strong>New Staff Orientation (NSO).&nbsp;</strong>Trainings are held in Florida except the summer training on a senior staff training year, see below, which is then held in Ft Collins, CO.</p><h2 class="p1">Full New Staff Training</h2><p>Cru offers this&nbsp;<strong>four-week training</strong>&nbsp;every winter and summer (note that new staff members are expected to also attend Cru's national staff conference, which is held every other summer in Ft. Collins, CO. This would extend the time to five weeks for those attending that summer). Childcare is offered.</p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span class="s4">The <strong>Institute of Biblical Studies </strong></span>provides in-depth biblical training led by seminary professors and Cru staff members who have earned seminary degrees<br /><br /></li><li class="li1"><span class="s4"></span><b>New Staff </b><strong>Orientation</strong>&nbsp;is designed to help new staff learn about Cru&rsquo;s past, present and vision for the future. At this training,&nbsp;new staff get to meet ministry leaders and learn about our unique financial policies.&nbsp;Ministry Partner Development (MPD) training equips new staff to develop their financial support team.</li></ul><h2 class="p1"><br />New Staff Orientation (NSO)</h2><p>Cru offers this 10 day training 4 times a year. In the spring and fall only New Staff Orientation is offered and it is also offered summer and winter in the context of the full training.</p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span class="s4"><strong>New Staff Orientation </strong></span>Is open to anyone but can tend to attract mid careers, families, or those whose employment will not allow them to take four weeks off. Childcare: You are welcome to bring (and register) a friend or family member with you to stay with your children while you attend sessions, but if you choose to use the conference-supplied childcare the NSO sessions are long and your time will be tight.&nbsp; It is likely that your child will be in childcare for 9+ hours daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;All new staff members who attend the shorter New Staff Orientation and do not hold a theological degree are required to complete the first year classes through The Institute of Biblical Studies (IBS) courses&nbsp;before they report to their first AIA assignment. One class is taken online while doing MPD and then you must take the remaining 2 classes prior to reporting. &nbsp;You can learn more about IBS <a href="http://ibs.cru.org/">here</a>.</li></ul><h2><br />Completed Application Deadlines</h2><p>The deadlines below indicate when we must have a completed application, which includes a detailed online application, all reference forms completed, and a staff interview when required.
