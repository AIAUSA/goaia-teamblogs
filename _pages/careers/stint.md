A STINT will typically last 9-12 months, starting late August or early September. There is an option of continuing on your assignment for up to one additional year.</span></strong></p><p class="p2"></p><p>For additional information on STINTs, email the <a href="mailto:aiastint@athletesinaction.org">Stint Department</a>.</p><p></p><h2 class="p1">Qualifications</h2><p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because AIA is a faith-based organization, potential staff members must meet unique qualifications. Learn more </span><a href="http://goaia.org/careers/qualifications"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></strong>&nbsp;</p><h2>Application Deadline</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STINT application deadline is </span><b>March 1st.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is when we must have a completed application. A completed application includes a submitted online application and all reference forms completed. &nbsp;This could take numerous weeks to accomplish. We recommend you start the process well before the deadline.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">All STINT team departure dates are typically around the end of August or early September. Depending on your international location, <g class="gr_ gr_80 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="80" data-gr-id="80">departure</g> could be earlier or later than that.</span></strong></p><h2 class="p1">Applying</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read all the information on this page then go to the Application Details tab at the top for information on how to apply.</span></p><h2 class="p1">Receiving International Acceptance</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our desire is to complete the whole application process as quickly as possible. It may take a couple weeks for us to process your full application. Once processed, we will contact you by phone and email with our acceptance decision.</span></p><h2 class="p1">Placement Decisions</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your international placement will be determined in conjunction with your initial placement request, and AIA and Cru&rsquo;s international leadership. Your specific placement may or may not be confirmed at the time of your international acceptance. Because of the nature of potential international instability and circumstances, your initially given placement location may change.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently seeking to send STINT teams to Puerto Rico, East <g class="gr_ gr_73 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="73" data-gr-id="73">Asia</g> and South Africa.</span></strong></p><h2 class="p1">Ministry Partner Development (MPD)</h2><p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone serving a STINT is required to raise the necessary funds to serve internationally. Your support goals will be based on your specific placement. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll provide MPD materials, <g class="gr_ gr_85 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="85" data-gr-id="85">training</g> and a personal MPD coach to help you in this process.</span></strong></p><h2 class="p1">Debt Limits</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have personal or school loan debt, your debt load may impact your ability to STINT with AIA.</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A STINT salary does <g class="gr_ gr_86 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="86" data-gr-id="86">allows</g> you to use a portion of your income to pay off loans. Salary ranges are modest. If you have a large debt load including school loans, car payment, credit card debt etc. you may not be able to live successfully on a STINT salary.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may consider deferment on student loans until after your STINT or pay interest only so that the debt is not higher at the end of your STINT. It is your responsibility to contact your loan administrator for any requests you may have regarding these options.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your parents may consider helping with debt payment during the STINT year.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your debt load is such that it would prevent you from coming on staff (typically over $30,000+ for singles) you will only be allowed to STINT for one year. A <g class="gr_ gr_82 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="82" data-gr-id="82">2nd year</g> STINT is an exception. &nbsp;If you plan to come on staff, your debt limit must be below the Cru maximum allowed.</span></li><li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are unsure about your debt, please contact </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat Lower</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of the application process. She can help you assess your situation and give you potential solutions. You must have your loan balances and interest rates for a calculation when you contact her</span></strong></li></ol><p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></strong></p><h2 class="p1">Contact Us</h2><p>For additional information on STINT, email the <a href="mailto:aiastint@athletesinaction.org">STINT Department</a>, We will be glad to answer and further questions or concerns. &nbsp;</p><h2 class="p1">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p class="p3">Here are answers to the questions we&rsquo;re asked most often. Keep in mind that because of varying placement locations, no single answer speaks to all situations.</p><p class="p3"><b>I&rsquo;m married. Does my spouse also need to fill out an application?</b></p><p class="p1">Yes. Because we consider a husband and wife to be a team, couples must be in agreement as to their leading to Athletes in Action. Both must apply and be accepted for STINT.&nbsp;</p><p class="p2"><b>How long will the application process take?</b></p><p class="p1">Expect the application process to take about six weeks from the time we receive your <span class="s1">completed</span> application until you receive your final decision.</p><p class="p3"><b>How do I know if God wants me to go on STINT?</b></p><p class="p1">This is the hardest question to answer. We believe God speaks in many ways:&nbsp; through the Bible (in verses like Genesis 12:1-6, Revelation 7:9 and Acts 1:8), through our friends and family, through desires to know other cultures and languages, through convictions to invest our lives in eternal things and through desires to answer the call for spiritual laborers (Matthew 9:36-38). You may have been on a summer mission project in the country where you desire to STINT and developed a heart for that nation.&nbsp;</p><p class="p2">STINTERs have seen God use this experience to expand His Kingdom, challenge and develop them and to allow them to learn ministry skills that are relevant even after their STINT ends.&nbsp;</p><p class="p3"><b>How will my parents respond when I tell them I want to go on STINT?</b></p><p class="p1">Their reaction may range from excitement, worry, nervousness, surprise or even opposition. Maybe they were expecting you to go straight <g class="gr_ gr_185 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="185" data-gr-id="185">into</g><span class="s6"> </span>grad school or find a job. Especially at first, there may be some tension and/or anxiety. That&rsquo;s okay, but it&rsquo;s important to continue communicating with them and to be understanding about their concerns. Realize that God can work in this situation. Even Christian parents often need time to adjust to the idea of their son or daughter moving to a foreign country for a year. But, we&rsquo;re always surprised and encouraged by how many parents (even non-Christians) end up becoming enthusiastic and supportive of their child&rsquo;s decision to go on STINT.</p><p class="p3"><b>What will be my ministry focus during STINT?</b></p><p class="p1">Your target audience will be athletes and others influenced by sport. The mission of AIA is to see a Christ-follower on every team, in every sport, in every nation.</p><p class="p3"><b>What will I do on a daily basis?</b></p><p class="p1">Your time will be divided between sharing your faith, developing relationships with national athletes and meeting with them one-on-one for spiritual training, special outreach events, large group meetings, team Bible studies and meetings, language classes and administrative work (like writing your newsletters, preparing materials and making phone calls).</p><p><b>How do I know what to do?</b></p><p class="p1">The one-week STINT briefing (held in Chicago in mid-August&nbsp;just prior to departure) is incredibly helpful. The AIA staff members in <g class="gr_ gr_187 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="187" data-gr-id="187">country</g> will train you, and you&rsquo;ll receive training visits and/or phone calls from AIA staff members in the U.S<span class="s1">.</span></p><p class="p2"><b>Where will I live on STINT?</b></p><p class="p1">You&rsquo;ll live in an apartment on or near the campus of sports universities and room with your teammates. &nbsp;You can rent furnished or unfurnished apartments.&nbsp;</p><p class="p2"><b>How do you pay for STINT?</b></p><p class="p1">You&rsquo;ll be responsible for developing a team of ministry partners &mdash; people who pray for you and contribute financially to cover the cost of your living expenses.&nbsp;To develop this team you&rsquo;ll contact friends, family and churches through letters, phone calls and personal appointments. You&rsquo;ll have the privilege of telling them about your needs and the chance to join your team through giving and prayer. Many people consider it a blessing to be able to give, and they contribute on a monthly basis or with a one-time gift. It generally takes anywhere from two to four months to raise $2<span class="s1">,</span>000-3<span class="s1">,</span>000 in monthly funding and over $5<span class="s1">,</span>000 for one-time expenses (amounts vary according to cost of living in each city). After being accepted for STINT, you&rsquo;ll receive training to help develop your team.</p><p class="p2"><b>Can I continue to compete in my sport or continue to work out?</b></p><p class="p1">In most <g class="gr_ gr_189 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="189" data-gr-id="189">cases</g> there are opportunities to continue competing in your sport during your STINT. Often STINTers compete on club teams in the country where they&rsquo;re serving. You&rsquo;ll have opportunities to keep working out.</p><p class="p2"><strong><b>Can I go home <g class="gr_ gr_213 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="213" data-gr-id="213">for for</g> holidays or special events (weddings, funerals, etc.)?</b></strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STINTers are expected to stay in <g class="gr_ gr_206 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="206" data-gr-id="206">country</g> throughout the STINT year and will not return home until their determined return date. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family visits: &nbsp;There are specific times during the year when your family could visit. These pre-determined times will be decided on by your team leaders and in-country leadership.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holidays: &nbsp;For many STINTers, celebrating the holidays with their team and other missionaries in their country is a highlight of the year.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weddings and Funerals: &nbsp;You may be allowed to return home for a wedding or a funeral of an immediate family member. If the person is not an immediate family member, the decision to allow a STINT team member to return to the USA is determined on a case by case basis. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware, if you have made commitments before you apply for STINT, your responsibility to your STINT team and AIA&rsquo;s mission will take first priority.</span></p><p class="p1"><b>What about the language?</b></p><p class="p1">Many individuals you&rsquo;ll work with speak English, but some of your <g class="gr_ gr_199 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="199" data-gr-id="199">ministry</g> will take place in the native language. You&rsquo;ll study the language in some capacity while on STINT (in classes and/or with a private tutor). &nbsp;Typically STINTers see a lot of progress in their language ability, but it&rsquo;s always challenging<span class="s1">.</span></p><p class="p2"><b>What do I do if I get sick overseas?</b></p><p class="p1">You&rsquo;ll bring your own medicines and health books, although&nbsp;a western doctor is available in most ministry locations. In <g class="gr_ gr_204 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="204" data-gr-id="204">case</g> of extreme circumstances, all STINTers have medical evacuation insurance that provides the means to be flown to the nearest western medical facility within hours of a request<span class="s1">.</span></p><p class="p2"><b>How will I connect with my team?</b></p><p class="p1">You might join a team that already exists in the country where you&rsquo;re serving. Or you may be a part of a new team that forms to pioneer a new campus or <g class="gr_ gr_193 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="193" data-gr-id="193">help</g> develop new ministries.</p></div></div>
